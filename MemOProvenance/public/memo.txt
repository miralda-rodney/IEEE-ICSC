<!-- 
Planned Classes 

knowyourmeme.com has more than just memes... 
There are:
Cultures
Events
Memes
People
Sites
Subcultures

The URL structure is always: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/abc/xyz
Where:
abc is one of the categories
xyz is a specific instance of said category

As such, I plan on creating classes for each of these categories.
The data population will be exactly the same, but there will be some parent class: Category (will have to resolve name with the Category class already here).

  <textRepresentation>ew Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash following the announcement that the 2019 video games Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield will not include the full roster of Pokmon from previous games and only include Pokmon that appear in the Galar Pokdex This is the first game in the series that will not allow for some Pokmon from previous generations of Pokmon titles The backlash also occurred within the Japanese arm of the fandom where it spread on Twitter and Pixiv under the hashtag  compatibility cut Background On June 11th 2019 during the Nintendo Treehouse showcase at Nintendos E3 event there was a showcase for the Pokmon Sword and Shield on the game floor During the end of the showcase Pokmon director Junichi Masuda announced in advance that in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield players will only be able to transfer Pokmon from the Pokmon Home app if they appear within the Galar region Pokdex thereby removing the possibility for certain monsters to be playable at all The reason for this move has been attributed to a number of issues such as efforts to balance the games roster and reducing the number of character models within the game data to make for higher quality animations Masuda also appeared to state that this would be the policy for all future games in the series4 Speaking to USGamer5 Masuda said We knew at some point we werent going to be able to indefinitely keep supporting all of the Pokemon We just found that Sword and Shield would probably be a good point to go back and reevaluate what would be the best selection of Pokemon that appeal to the widest audience while keeping into consideration the balance of the battle system It isnt just going to be allnew Pokemon in the Galar region Pokedex theres still going to be a lot of favorites that fans will be able to bring over that theyve adventured with previously But yeah it was pretty much just balancing and getting this optimal selection of Pokemon for the adventure we wanted to provide Developments Following the announcement fans were quick to voice their disapproval for not being able to transfer their Pokmon to the latest entries Twitter users started the BringBackNationalDex hashtag amounting over seven thousands tweets in a day1 Part of the disapproval stemmed from doubt in Masudas explanation for why the Pokmon were cut Twitter user shofu tweeted a sarcastic example of the games animation being high quality gaining over 5900 retweets and 21000 likes shown below User ExoExplorer tweeted a similar joke gaining over 1200 retweets and 3000 likes shown below right Junichi Masuda reaffirms that the sheer volume of high quality animations and desire to balance further resulted in the decision to block transfer of some Pokmon This is some high quality animation alright pictwittercomgwXJCrXLqD Garbage shofu June 12 2019 Yeah I just found this clip The animation on those wingull is really something I feel completely comforted knowing we had to sacrifice the national dex for this step up in quality BringBackNationalDex PokemonE3 pictwittercomd4tGVdBnbG ExoExplorer ExoExplorer June 12 2019 Others created memes decrying the change Twitter user extendedfreeze2 tweeted an object labeling meme about the change gaining over 280 retweets and 740 likes shown below left User Roeltje6663 also posted an object labeling meme about the change gaining 7 retweets and 30 likes shown below right The controversy was covered by multiple gaming outlets including Polygon who defended the decision against criticism3 writing Many miffed players are calling Game Freak lazy for not bringing the entire compendium of 800 monsters into Sword and Shield which is a wild thing to say The problem isnt laziness The problem if you can call it that is a difference in priorities If Game Freak thought it was important to have the entire Pokdex available in the Galar region it would do exactly that Instead the developer seems to be putting its focus on other portions of the game We know that Sword and Shield will have raids an open world extended online capabilities and a 3D camera all in addition to improved graphics Gamesradar4 also covered the criticism understanding that while it would surely be difficult to model 800 Pokmon into future Pokmon titles If your favourite Pokemon isnt chosen for Sword and Shield well tough luck Theres seemingly very little we can do about it If you dont get lucky with the next games Pokemon Catapult and Trebuchet anyone either your Pokemon will simply be stuck in Pokemon Home limbo unable to progress any further Masudas Message On June 28th 2019 the official Pokmon twitter made an announcement a message for Pokmon video game fans The link sent users to the official Pokmon page with a statement from Junichi Masuda Thank you to all of our fans for caring so deeply about Pokmon Recently I shared the news that some Pokmon cannot be transferred to Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield Ive read all your comments and appreciate your love and passion for Pokmon Just like all of you we are passionate about Pokmon and each and every one of them is very important to us After so many years of developing the Pokmon video games this was a very difficult decision for me Id like to make one thing clear even if a specific Pokmon is not available in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield that does not mean it will not appear in future games The world of Pokmon continues to evolve The Galar region offers new Pokmon to encounter Trainers to battle and adventures to embark on We are pouring our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward to joining us on this new journey June 28 2019 Junichi Masuda After the message fans were quick to call out the statement for the lack of any promises for the newer entries in the series who were hoping for future patches While other were angered that Masuda made a response to the backlash Search Interest External References 1 Twitter  bringbacknationaldex 2 Twitter  extendedfreezer 3 Polygon  Why Pokmon Sword and Shields limited Pokdex is such a huge deal to fans 4 Gamesradar  Pokemon transfer policy changes as Game Freak confirms

reads Ok guys i feel like we need to formulate a game plan Ive put together this easy to follow diagram here for a proposed plan The basic idea is that the Kyles form the front line if we feed them enough psilocybin and monster energy and say that anyone in camouflage is their step dad and the entire base is made of drywall then they will go berserk and become an impenetrable wall Then the Rock Throwers will throw pebbles at the inevitable resistance we dont want to hurt them we just want to annoy them enough to not shoot the Kyles as often While this is all happening the two Naruto runner battalions will run full speed around the north and south flank and shadow clone jutsu effectively tripling our numbers and overwhelm the base red circle PS Hello US government this is a joke and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet Im not responsible if people decide to actually storm area 51 During the

  <textRepresentation>AntMan Will Defeat Thanos by Crawling Up His Butt and Expanding also known as the Thanus Theory refers to a humorous fan theory speculating that in the 2019 Marvel superhero film Avengers Endgame the character AntMan will defeat Thanos by entering the villains body through the anus while in his microscopic form and rapidly expand from the inside killing Thanos in the process In March 2019 the theory spawned a series of related memes on Reddit Origin Prior to the release of 2018 film Avengers The Infinity War several users online proposed various theories on how Avengers could defeat supervillain Thanos some of which relied on AntMans ability to shrink to minuscule size and expand back For example on July 29th 2017 Redditor sodabased suggested that Avengers could put Hulk in the AntMans suit get him inside Thanoss mouth and let him expand back once he reaches the supervillians urethra1 On December 10th 2017 Redditor iwasherenotyou suggested that AntMan himself could enter Thanos body and expand2 On December 19th 2017 Redditor maxwellthebeech posted a mockup poster of AntMan climbing Thanoss ear in rMarvel subreddit where it gained over 1300 upvotes In the comments several Reddit users speculated on the idea of AntMan killing Thanos by expanding from inside his body with Redditor Rayhann suggesting that AntMan could crawl up his ass and deeply violate his very being which would traumatize him3 Months later on March 16th 2018 Redditor16 bigblackhotdog posted in the rmarvelstudios subreddit If antman gets small goes into thanos b hole and then grows big would thanos grow with him or explode in ecstacy Spread On March 19th 2018 Tumblr 15 user tanjonathans wrote infinity war is a dumb movie cause why would you bother all those heroes to fight thanos when all you have to do is get antman inside his asshole make him grow back to his normal size and thats it purple joss whedon is dead The post received more than 139000 notes in one year shown below On April 30th 2018 Twitter4 user filmgloss speculated on a potential reason why AntMan did not appear in recently released Avengers Infinity War making a reference to the humorous theory The post gained over 11000 retweets and 30400 likes in one year On May 1st 2018 Tumblr user astew posted a screenshot of the tweet which gained over 83200 likes and reblogs in the same period5 In the following months the possibility of the theory working was discussed on Reddit and other online platforms6 On June 7th 2018 YouTuber John Campea posted an analysis of the theory shown below left7 On July 20th YouTube channel entertainmentie released a video interview with the AntMan actor Paul Rudd in which they asked the actor about the theory shown below right I almost think its a question for Thanos If there is one thing we learned from Infinity War it is that Thanos can take a lot of punishment And so you know On March 14th 2019 Redditor Aimless_Devastator commented Are we still betting on Antman defeating Thanos by crawling up his butt then expanding in rmovies thread dedicated to an Avengers Endgame trailer In the thread Redditor Nolio1212 posted a response which gained over 15200 upvotes in six days quoted below8 I thought about this and I cant think of a worse death for Antman Thanos is pretty tough like can take some punches from the Hulk kindoftough well his butthole and insides have to be hulklevel strong too The way I see it happening is Antman crawling up his butt expanding and then whatever I can describe as the chunky human soup that would come flying out of Thanos ass from Antman trying to expand into something that just wont budge On the same day Redditor x720xHARDSCOPEx posted the comment in rcopypasta subreddit gaining over 8200 upvotes in six days9 On March 15th 2019 Redditor KushPatil made a post referencing the theory in rprequelmemes subreddit which received over 50800 upvotes in five days10 In March 2019 numerous notable posts referencing the theory appeared in rdankmemes1112 subreddit Josh Brolins Response On March 28th 2019 Thanos actor Josh Brolin posted an old video of exerting himself on a toilet bowl13 hashtagged flushanantman as a reference to the theory The video gained over 12 million views and 280000 likes in 24 hours The original video was first posted by Brolin on April 21st 201814 View this post on Instagram The tension

Brolina joshbrolin on Mar 28 2019 at 349pm PDT Scientific Explanation On April 2nd 2019 Mel Magazine17 published A BIOPHYSICIST EXPLAINS HOW ANTMAN COULD KILL THANOS FROM INSIDE HIS ASS In the article the author writes the various results of what could happen if AntMan performed the theory Alex Klotz from MIT said If AntMan were more fluid as he expanded he would splurt through the two sphincters on either side of the rectum out of the anus and into the colon However based on videos of him shrinking and growing it looks like he can only expand isotropically without changing shape I can think of three possibilities he just gets stuck rectumsized until he shrinks again he tries to expend but builds up so much pressure that it kills him Antman splurts out of the anus Ultimately he concludes that because of both Thanos strength and the power of the Power Stone Thanos body may be more resilient than normal Therefore AntMan might not burst through Thanos entire body Klotz says Each tissue and connection in the body has its own strength and its own limits so even if he can expand through the rectal wall I dont know if for example the same could be said about breaking the pelvis So AntMan may burst through the anus but possibly not the entirety of Thanos body Literally tearing him a new one will do plenty of damage in its own right and at the very least itll be extremely unpleasant Chuck Tingle Adaptation On April 10th 2019 erotica novelist Chuck Tingle released an erotic adaptation of the theory entitled Revengers Buttgame Antguy Gets Small To Go Into Thamos Butt And Then Gets Big And Hard18 That day the author tweeted19 please enjoy new tingler superhero event REVENGERS BUTTGAME ANTGUY GETS SMALL TO GO INTO THAMOS BUTT AND THEN GETS BIG AND HARD out now The post

incomplete product bugs and selling the beta as a demo  it is buggy the engine clearly isnt made well for it The FOV is locked to a level that can cause litteral if minor health issues for some people and the FPS is locked as the speed of some parts are tied to FPS which is almost a cardinal sin in modern game production  The difficulty is so low that cooperation is discouraged The world is very empty little to do really outside grinding mobs that die incredibly fast and collecting loot The quests are cookiecutter types we have seen a million times before As of November 20th the game has a critic score of 51100 on Metacritic4 Additionally pictures of a physical copy of the game released with the 200 power armor special edition of Fallout 76 revealed that the physical copy inside the

  <textRepresentation>Big Chungus refers to an image of the cartoon character Bugs Bunny usually captioned with the phrase Big Chungus and presented as a game for PlayStation 4 console The word chungus was coined by video game journalist Jim Sterling several years before the meme became popular Origin Fat Bugs Bunny The image of Bugs Bunny appears in Merrie Melodies cartoon Wabbit Twouble first shown on December 20th 19411 In the short Bugs is mocking Elmer Fudd who in this cartoon was made much more portly than his previous and more iconic design clip shown below On May 27th 2017 an anonymous 4chan2 user posted the image of obese Bugs Bunny to lit board shown below upper left The next appearance of the image on 4chan can be tracked to July 19th 20173 shown below upper right with more posts containing it appearing on lit and other boards later that year45 On July 21st 2017 Redditor6 hollerbravo uploaded a screencap of 4chan thread containing the image to r4Chan subreddit On July 27th 2017 a captioned image of obese Bugs Bunny was posted7 by Eclectic Memes Facebook group The post has since been deleted with copies scraped by Meme8 and Onsizzle9 Chungus The word chungus was allegedly coined by English freelance video game journalist Jim Sterling who would often use it in various meanings without a set definition10 The exact date when the word was first used is currently unknown but is estimated to be prior to December 2012 On December 26th 2012 Urban Dictionary11 user Whidmark submitted an entry for Chungus defining it as a word meaning anything and everything including but not limited to a chunky anus On August 8th 2016 in a Reddit thread exploring the origin of Chungus Redditor12 ASuitofT51PowerArmor posted his own description of Chungus based on Sovereigns speech13 from Mass Effect videogame The comment would later resurge as a copypasta in December 2018 Chungus has no beginning Chungus has no end Chungus is infinite Millions of years after our civilization has been eradicated and forgotten Chungus will endure Chungus is eternal The pinnacle of evolution and existence We are but rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh We touch Chungus mind fumbling in ignorance incapable of understanding Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation an accident Our lives are measured in years and decades We wither and die Chungus is eternal Before it we are nothing Chungus imposes order on the chaos of organic life We exist because Chungus allows it and we will end because Chungus demands it Chungus transcends our very understanding We cannot grasp the nature of Chungus existence Big Chungus The very first instance of a meme containing the caption Big Chungus was posted by an unknown iFunny account on November 27th 2016 and contained an image of a Second Life life character bearing the nickname shown below left27 On March 20th 2018 the image of fat Bugs Bunny was first paired with the phrase by Redditor GaryTheTaco but was not been made public until it was posted to rcomedyheaven on December 1st 2018 shown below right14 In a rOutOfTheLoop thread launched by Redditor PunkyFickle on December 19th GaryTheTaco claimed authorship of the image15 providing further proof in a post to rBigChungus subreddit16 The true story behind Big Chungus is back in March I made the meme to send to a friend when Inwas bored in class he didnt think much of it Over the summer I sent it to another friend he thought it was hilarious so I made Big Chungus 2 then 3 and so on Then I just sort of forgot about it until 2 weeks ago when I thought Hey lets post it to rcomedyheaven It got some traction there but the real traction came a week later when my friend sent me a post from Facebook of a kid who asked his mom for Big Chungus That was later reposted and got 10x the karma as the original Big Chungus the OP of that DMd me saying he was a meme thief TLDR its just a fat Bugs Bunny PS4 game that got popular because a clueless mom asked a Gamestop employee if they had it in stock like the Battletoads trend Spread On September 16th 2018 rBigChungus17 subreddit was created by Redditor youarepepemangay however the subreddit did not share any connection with the meme until it gained popularity in December 2018 On December 7th 2018 GameStop store manager Justin Laufer made a Facebook18 post sharing a story of a customer who wanted to purchase a game named Big Chungus for PlayStation 4 On the next day Twitter19 user fluffypkmn shared a screenshot of Laufers post The tweet went viral gathering more than 13800 retweets within a twoweek period On December 10th 2018 Redditor20 j_dot21 reposted a meme originally created by urepublicof_Taiwan21 mentioning the word chungus to rme_irl subreddit shown below left The post gained more than 7900 upvotes over a 10day period On December 13th 2018 Redditor22 namffauk uploaded one of the screenshots posted by fluffypkmn to rcomedyheaven subreddit where it gained 13100 upvotes within a week show below right Between December 12th and 17th the creator of the original image posted Big Chungus sequels to rcomedyheaven subreddit shown below The meme subsequently rose to popularity in rdankmemes rsbubby and other subreddits with users posting new variations of the Bugs Bunny image and editing it into covers of popular video games Karen Chungus On January 5th 2019 Redditor turtlenometry submitted a screenshot of a Facebook page for Karen Chungus to the rBigChungus23 subreddit shown below left The profile was widely circulated along with references to the Big Chungus and Karen memes along with jokes about the antivaccination movement On January 7th Redditor Internal_Blaze submitted a Mafia Citythemed image macro comparing Big Chungus

  <textRepresentation>Mr Cool Ice is the selfgiven alias of Tommy Steinberger a German man known for numerous tattoos of skulls and the words Mr Cool ICE Origin While the exact origin of the original Mr Cool ICE pictures is unknown several early posts of the photographs link to a sincedeleted interview with Steinberger on the German website Starblind However the earliest known post of the photographs of Steinberger shirtless and flexing was posted on the website BME on August 28th 2005 shown below1 Spread Over the next decade the images of Mr Cool ICE were shared on various message boards including Democratic Underground2 pocketfives3 Something Awful 4 and more On May 17th 2007 pocketfives3 user vdog explained Mr Cool Ices background They wrote His hometown is Mainz he is 33 years old and has gone by Mr Cool Ice for the last 13 years He basically states thats just who he is period They do a tour of his apartment and we discover that he is a clean freak Everything has to be spotless and in the right place The 2 girls on the talk show are basically making an ass out of him and a direct translation from the girl sitting closest to him is You look like Shit He has spent over 4000 euros to get his tattoos which is about 6 000 USD On September 14th 2008 YouTuber iancities posted a video of the Mr Cool Ice photographs set to the music of the Jonas Brothers The post received more than 42000 views in ten years shown below left Two years later September 24th 2010 Sensor Magazine6 published an interview with Mr Cool Ice regarding his daily routine and lifestyle The interview featured several photographs of Mr Cool Ice shown below center and right Several years later on July 28th 2011 YouTuber JeremyUte shared a video of Mr Cool Ices appearance on Die Oliver Geissen Show a German daytime talkshow The post received more than 63000 views in seven years On June 6th 2018 Redditor 5 Somf_machine posted an English translation of the interview They wrote Mr Ice I made up the name myself so its mine patentregistered on me mmmh so I basically started here  by myself Frank wasnt there  to design the skull cut The logo originated from the fact that I wanted to have a skull you know on the jackets too back then when the tattoos werent uuh uhhhm somehow not to be realized in the near future and stuff and I really wanted the skull So but they only had Heavy Metal skulls everywhere but theyre aggressive to me Thats a direction I didnt wanna follow So thats why we did it at the tshirt shop took it from a skeleton changed the glasses that means removed the eyes put in glasses added veins brought out the teeth  really brought them out for the smile so it would fit the name he shouldnt be aggressive maybe a bit  I dont understand that word at all but also the peace maker type Mr Geissen You want to be called Ice why Ice Mr Ice Thats right because its my name which I actually use now cut Because Mr Cool always somehow seemed very cool to me and since I dig Vanilla Ice I added the Ice Mr Geissen Please turn around a very interesting part of your body is your back and it says MR COOL ICE Why Mr Ice I just wanted to represent something cut I wanted something which is mine something because a lot of people wear brands or represent things which are well Id say its just puton Voiceover Thomas Steinberger aka Mr Cool Ice loves public appearances In the pedestrian zone and on tv The 33 year old man from Mainz got his body in shape for that reason and had his own logo tattooed on himself A tshirt shop helped him with the design TShirt guy named Josef He came into the shop all casual approached me came straight to the point and well then we did it together and it was actually funny It first seemed a bit crazy having to design a tattoo in Corel Draw since we usually only do tshirts but since it was for Ice  who we already know for quite some time right Mr Ice I made up the name myself so its mine patentregistered on me mmmh so I basically started here  by myself Frank wasnt there  to design the skull cut The logo originated from the fact that I wanted to have a skull you know on the jackets too back then when the tattoos werent uuh uhhhm somehow not to be realized in the near future and stuff and I really wanted the skull So but they only had Heavy Metal skulls everywhere but theyre aggressive to me Thats a direction I didnt wanna follow So thats why we did it at the tshirt shop took it from a skeleton changed the glasses that means removed the eyes put in glasses added veins brought out the teeth  really brought them out for the smile so it would fit the name he shouldnt be aggressive maybe a bit  I dont understand that word at all but also the peace maker type TShirt guy We designed his business cards together for example Mr Ice I want people to ask to think about it if its true thats why it says on the top Mr Lover Lover below I put Mr Sex because thats my motto that I love sex just cool and geil geil is a stupid word which is basically used in the sense of cool awesome but also means horny that is for the stupid people who always think they have to put me in categories which doesnt work anyway Voiceover He already spent 4000 on his tattoos  according to Ice this investment in his body was worth it Actually he only wanted to have a few jackets printed  the thing with the tattoos was more or less coincidence Mr Ice I didnt really decide on it I was  I accompanied a buddy who always wanted a tattoo  who by the way hasnt got one to this day  and uhm was taken by surprise by the tattoo artist who said so your appointment is in two weeks and I was uhm uh  yeah and the problem is after your first one  not necessarily but you get addicted A tattoo is something youll have your whole life You should put a lot of thought in it and know if you just do it on a whim or because everybody else does it or to express something how do I want to express it where on what body I say Im Mr Cool Ice thats my name my thing and wont ruin it because its my whole body its my person and where I dont get away with it Im out of place anyway because I dont want to be there Voice Are there moments when you wish you didnt have any tattoos Mr Ice No Voice Never Mr Ice As soon as I get up and see myself in the mirror no Some might say its narcissistic but as I say to myself to do something like that you have to be a bit narcissistic Voiceover Mr Cool Ice  hes used that name for 13 years and for 5 years now its also on his body Mr Cool Ice sentence I dont understand Even without tattoos because some say I only got the tattoos to draw attention to myself so a long time ago I had longer hair and stuff but I was as crazy as I am now because a lot of people only see craziness in the tattoos or the name but thats not true Maybe I changed on the outside but my character and way of thought towards other people or regarding my life that never changed Voiceover in contrast to the colorful shows on tv Ice prefers tidiness discipline and housekeeping at home Mr Ice So it always looks very clean And down here theres nothing hidden all the cleaning supplies you see yeah its very very very very clean At my place its clean clean clean In my bathroom worse than a woman theres everything you need toothbrush toothbrush for visitors very important because I hate visiting other places and theres no toothbrush And no matter how drunk you should have a deodorant not just for yourself but for the others too A toilet should also be as clean as it is down here To all guys sit dont stand Because everybody who cleans up himself knows how talk show woman Mr Cool Ice will be very happy to appear here on stage because he describes himself as a male minx hellooooo random blah blah blonde woman sitting beside him youre ugly  Mr Ice Thats relative isnt it  blonde horrible horrible say what do you have here talk show woman what exactly is it a real minx does in your opinion Mr ice A minx is for me a woman who stands her ground and something more which I cant translate  geil dirty arrogant but with style and she maybe doesnt have that cut Im not a womanizer Im not macho Im not a sexbomb I always say I enjoy ladies and the other way round And I dont mean women have to do all the chores that would be too boring and I myself already clean up enough and like it Sex is very important to me not on top of the list but in second place and very big because if it doesnt work sexually even if the character or the whole person is great it wont work out Because Im a cheerful and above all sexual person I dont mean I have to have onenight stands or only half a year or a relationship forever the only thing I can say for sure is that I dont want to marry I always say my philosophy concerning marriage and getting children is getting married with 90 getting two children and dying with 120 Fidelity Fidelity is very important but basically things you dont want dont do to other people and let others live dont smother For Gods sake The longest relationship was three years I was faithful in every relationship So I had relationships well you cant call them relationships I enjoyed ladies I wasnt together with and that  I think he says something which means three at the same time but not in the foursome sense ahem but you have to be honest Voice How many ladies have you enjoyed so far Mr Ice Well Thats something I usually negate when people ask me I always say I love the ladies and then stupid gesture this guy really doesnt make sense sometimes voiceover His body is his everything so Ice works out regularly five times a week Mr Ice Fitness is awesome totally brilliant and I recommend it to everyone yeah Im against drugs of all kinds well I do drink alcohol sometimes sometimes one over the eight but when it comes to cigarettes pills heroin and so on  no I already work out for a couple of years and some might say hey you should have a really grandiose body by now but since I dont take drugs and partly worked out at home for a while its all natural And itll stay this way And well I need it During the years I worked out at home I missed something Thats maybe something like a drug like people always say Search Interest External References 1 BME  Whats cooler than being cool 2 Democratic Underground  Calling DU Tattooed Ladies

friend Erics older married cousin At the end of the story the girl ends up passionately kissing the man in front of him saying Dont worry he knows What to do b Ive been in love with the same girl for basically all my life but the situation is all flicked up now and I dont know how to stop flicking caring about her Pic related its her Be crushin on same girl for all my life Knew her since kindergarten Her parents are poor and live in a one bedroom with four kids so they dont care she sleeps over most nights Hang out almost everyday for years All our friends joke about us getting married one day She knows Im into her and she says she feels same way but doesnt want to label it Get her to make out but really not much more Says she likes me too much and is afraid well go all the way if we do anything more Resigned to being a virgin til I eventually many this girl Both of us mainly hang out with two other guys lets call Eric and Dave Mainly consists of playing Halo at my house Sometimes smoke weed when Eric can get it Talk about parties but never get invited Eric starts hanging out with his oldfag cousin sometimes Make fun of him for hanging out with 37 year old Says cousin buys beer and lets him smoke at his place wellwhydidnlyousaysointhefirstplacejpg Start going to his cousins place to drink and play halo once a week when his wife and kids are gone visiting wifes parents He buys the beer has food videogames not bad situation He can have a pretty annoying bossy attitude and thinks hes the king of our weekly hangs but whatever Start bringing the pseudogf to these things Cousin is always eyeing the fuck out of her but shes used to being the only girl at our hangs so whatever Sorry I suck at typing Even though this cousinfag knows that this girl should be off limits he is always flicking hitting on her Worst part is she doesnt seem to mind One day he asks her why it doesnt say Im her boyfriend on facebook mfw when she says Oh hes more like my best friend than anything seething anger when he says Man you gotta lock that shit down bro shes banging Only really see this cousinfag once a week and she still sleeps over all the time so thinking whatever nothing will come of it I keep telling her hes an asshole She agrees but tells me you know me I dont even know how to be rude Besides not like we can really stop going ritual is pretty ingrained at this point Eventually start combining Halo and drinking halo drinking games Were retards we didnt think of this sooner Old cousinfag instates random different rules all the time House rules he says Since pseudogf doesnt really play he sometimes has rules involving her She has to get the beers if theres a multikill shit like that One day he proposes she has to sit on lap of the guy who wins for the next game Randomly this oldfag is the best of us so rule is obviously for him I start to say Dude I dont think she wants When at the same time she laughs and says You boys implying okay Feel like a huge faggot for being too protective get red and just go with it She spends the majority of the next couple of hours on his lap Raging as we go home get in a fight with her make up as we always do Shit continues like this for the next few times Mostly lap sitting Sometimes they get her to do a joke sexy dance Nothing I can get publically too mad about My uncle has a wedding on the same day one of these hangs happens Ask her not to go She says she probably wont Ask her again basically begging this time She says shell try to get out of it but that the guys are pushy and shes bad at saying no Both true statements but I get mad at her telling her to have a spine Get in a fight again Dont have time to make up before leaving for wedding ihaveareallybadfeelingjpg Fidgeting entire weekend Text with her on ride back with the parents she says to call her once I get back by the tone I know she feels guilty ohfuckpng Turns out she had gotten too drunk and they incorporated stripping into the game cousin Eric and Dave all saw her completely naked Whattheflyingfuckjpg get in another fight mfw i realize that theyve gotten more sexual pleasure out of her than me at this point think its basically over have to find a new social life she calls me really late and comes over cries apologizing says she has a really big problem saying no and will try to fix it forgive her and go to bed cuddling Really awkward with Eric and Dave the next time I see them Dont really address it for a while but eventually we have an awkward apology talk since Im clearly pissed She stops going to the cousinfags for a while Eventually starts going again to repair all our broken friendships she says Things slowly but surely evolve back to where they were I know I gotta put a stop to this Realize booze is really the main difference between my place and oldfags Start taking booze out of parents cabinet when we play halo at my place Didnt really know what the fuck I was thinking since we still went to cousinfags as much as we used to Eventually parents find out My grades also been going down also Combination gets them megapissed Pseudogf cant sleep over and I cant go out for a week pseudogf and I fight over this cant even remember why the fuck we did Get text couple of days later from cousinfag telling us he has the place to himself so to come over n00000000000000000jpg Try to sneak out but get caught Frantically try to call her but shes still pissed not picking up Next day still no contact weekend so dont see her at school whatthefuckwhatthefuckingfuckjpg freak the fuck out basically having emotional breakdown see her at school when Monday finally fucking comes she avoids me all day she leaves before I can track her down afterschool text her a zillion times tell

the online backlash against perceived breaches of journalistic integrity on video game news sites that occurred as a result of the Quinnspiracy an online controversy surrounding indie game developer Zoe Quinns alleged affairs with a number of men working in the video game industry including Kotaku staff writer Nathan Grayson The term has also since been used to describe the group of internet users based mainly on Twitter who claim that there is a lack of transparency within the video game journalism industry These same people have also been criticized of practicing misogyny and sexism by many through harassment and trolling referring to their opposition as social justice warriors Background The Zoe Post On August 16th 2014 game developer Zoe Quinns exboyfriend Eron Gjoni published an online expose detailing their relationship called the Zoe Post In the expose Gjoni claims Quinn cheated on him with several men in the gaming industry including Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson These claims were subsequently refuted by Kotaku editorinchief Steve Totilo in a post on the website76 In this post he claims that the only time Nathan mentioned Quinn was in a post about a gaming competition known as GameJam77 The day following the publication of the Zoe Post YouTuber MundaneMatt uploaded a video critiquing Quinns game Depression Quest and commenting on the alleged affairs

cancerous growths that have infiltrated reddit The internet The world I did this Now I am undoing it This abomination should have always been aborted So in this moment with years of contemplation I am Stopping it Im closing shop and I cant allow anyone to exploit my handicap Ive watched and read every day Every single day The mods are good at what they do but they are moderating over a sub that should not exist The users have created content that should not be Topics that do not require debate And often times molded by outside forces We are better than this I should have been better than this Just look at the comment history of any users history The hate is spread by very few but very often Overwhelmingly so Reddit and its Admins are Me They are the stewards of hate and divisiveness

business need to thrive if we are to be a healthy nation Incorporations will always lead to monopolies There is no other outcome They paid their way invested into feigning the populace that they are doing what is in their best interest Righting a Wrong Beginnings I created KIA thinking no one would join and when I awoke I had many hundreds of orangereds Wow WTF did I say or do that caused this KiA began Im surprised and excited that we had over 100 users So I began So it began I created a few rudimentary rules and began enforcing them The next days added a couple hundred and then a few thousand This was becoming a monster The Birth I was moderating 247 and it was clear that I could not sustain these rules on my own These rules were the site rules Dont break them and you dont get banned Its only fair Free speech needs protection even unwanted and hurtful speech Hate speech was allowed but I was having difficulty defining everything Does saying nigger cunt as a noun the same as using it as a verb So I began seeking help from users that I believed had the subreddits purpose and shared my own vision for its future Moderation Im not sure how but it was a success The next top mod was an A personality and highly knowledgeable of the subs content Amazing Everything was going as planned Despite JRs infiltration and attempted creation of a scandal TwasIWhoShotJR We began a great chat IRC and then even began livestreams Sometimes with famous guests having insane meltdowns That was drama Going forward We worked on creating fundamental rules and attempting to wrestle with how to define what content was acceptable We still cant get this perfect despite public outcry and threats The next steps Everything was going as planned and as its creator and top moderator I was able to give shape and vision to its continued future In doing so we over moderated At least we thought we were Bans up the wazoo and massive amounts of removed comments In retrospect we were mostly unable to as users found ways around the rules We did get better Hate This was a dark time We were wrestling with how to control hate speech Not only what was said but what people could link to KiA became infested with racism and sexism  and other isms  though many isms are not real GG forums were created on KiwiFarms and 8chan as a result This was the best and worst thing The monster was now a virus We banned links to and then mention of certain links and topics Now we became the enemy A new phase This is when I handed over supervisory control I really wanted to close the sub I was in the process of until I was superseded not to Ive been wanting to close every day since I was just too scared of the backlash How ironic is that Ive been trying to please everyone when I should be forcing my wants and visions for the subreddit to be executed I rolled over and played dead After this nothing much matters I was too weak I let the other mods dictate My own flaws and faults compromised my ability to raise my iron fist This was a monumental failure Im ASD and GAD Many of you know this Many of you dont believe this I have allowed myself confidence and an ability to assert myself Ive been captive my entire life and now I have the ability to make my own decisions and to correct my mistakes KiA is a huge one I think about this daily and dream about it Its a boogeyman The monster under my bed in my head Until now KiA is one of the many cancerous growths that have infiltrated reddit The internet The world I did this Now I am undoing it This abomination should have always been aborted So in this moment with years of contemplation I am Stopping it Im closing shop and I cant allow anyone to exploit my handicap Ive watched and read every day Every single day The mods are good at what they do but they are moderating over a sub that should not exist The users have created content that should not be Topics that do not require debate And often times molded by outside forces We are better than this I should have been better than this Just look at the comment history of any users history The hate is spread by very few but very often Overwhelmingly so Reddit and its Admins are Me They are the stewards of hate and divisiveness and they let it go They go so far as to even claim there is nothing they can do about it Those with upvotes could have been stopped by others with equally powerful downvotes Fallacy 100 evil people with 100000 upvotes can not be defeated by 100000 with 100 downvotes Dont let Reddit pretend otherwise They know what goes on here They know

created institutions where the losers keep losing Small business need to thrive if we are to be a healthy nation Incorporations will always lead to monopolies There is no other outcome They paid their way invested into feigning the populace that they are doing what is in their best interest I may be ASD but Im no longer a victim Shout out to rThe_Donald  Compared to you Im a MiniMe Im scratching an itch yet you are a viral cancer that is destroying the minds of millions of Reddit users each day And they allow it They in fact have to Conflict breeds users and drives viewer counts driving advertisers and required profits After all who would invest in a company that loses money Reddit is only a small problem but Ill end it here Those with power use it to create a stronger hold on that power Human nature to be 1 At least Reddit is sooo overly tolerant that they could never remove this post httpswwwusagovregistertovote httpswwwindivisibleorg Thanks to ironcally Google This looks like and sounds like a rant Its not Its a warning Free the free press The 1st amendment demands it KotakuinAction has beed a wildly successful failure in this endevour of The 1st Thanks rThe_donald  Youve shown me the darkness Im hoping to pave your way to the light The post has since been removed from rKotakuInAction and placed on rdrama104 Following the post the subreddit was briefly shutdown That day rKotakuInAction moderator HandofBane posted about the outage105 They wrote So some of you may have noticed as the 60ish modmails asking what happened can affirm that the sub went private for about 4550 minutes not too long ago Heres what happened davidme apparently went off the deep end making a long screed post on another sub about nuking KiA as he made KiA private kicked the entire mod team nuked the CSS and generally made a clusterfuck of things Thankfully an amazing admin was online who helped restore everything and has locked davids permissions to mailonly while an investigation goes on into the matter later before they decide if anything further needs to be done We dont expect him to stay at the top of the list afterward but thats more in the admins hands than ours right now He was supposed to act as an emergency failsafe in case one of us did what he did to the sub  clearly he failed at that role In the mean time we are sorting out whats still broken and what we can fix easily Flairs may not be fully back but some appear to be We are seeing what else isnt quite working right if you notice something not working how it did yesterday please drop us a modmail so we can look into fixing it Apologies to everyone for the downtime hopefully this gets sorted out to where that can never happen again Search Interest External References 1 Adam Baldwin GamerGate Tweet  Adam

a report based on interviews with numerous current and former employees of Epic games alleging that the success of Fortnite has created a stressful and hostile working environment in which working overtime  while officially voluntary  was an expected service to the company Sources claim to regularly work in excess of 70hour weeks with some reporting 100hour weeks While these employees were paid overtime the expectation of long hours has had adverse effects on the staff they claim Some reported health issues from exhaustion and stress while others claimed it created a toxic work environment This was compounded by reports that employees would often work weekends and find it difficult to take away from work One anonymous employee said I work an average 70 hours a week Theres probably at least 50 or even 100 other people at Epic working those hours I know people who pull 100hour weeks The company gives us unlimited time off but its almost impossible to take the time If I take time off the workload falls on other people and no one wants to be that guy These employees said that the issues stem from the frequent updates that are necessary to keep Fortnite popular These patches require near constant attention creating a heftier and more demanding workload A spokesperson for the company said Fortnite achieved a far higher level of success than we had ever anticipated Everybody throughout Epic responded to the success with incredible vigor and commitment The Fortnite team rapidly expanded the game to grow the audience the Unreal Engine team began a broad effort to optimize for 60fps and support seven platforms others throughout the company moved to Fortnite to maintain momentum However employees have disputed that executives have done anything to make the work environment more tenable Some have said that to push back or even leave work can be a mark against their character This is especially true for contract employees who claim not working these expected long hours could result in not having their contracts renewed One employee told Polygon One senior guy would say Just get more bodies Thats what the contractors were called bodies And then when were done with them we can just dispose of them They can be replaced with fresh people who dont have the toxic nature of being disgruntled That day Redditor48 Mlghubben1e posted about the report in the

  <textRepresentation>ew Donald Trumps Alleged Sexual Encounter with Stormy Daniels refers to the scandal surrounding the allegation that Donald Trump had sex with porn star Stormy Daniels in 2006 a year after he married Melania Trump and his campaign during the 2016 United States Presidential Election paid Daniels 130000 to not speak of it Background On January 12th 2018 the Wall Street Journal1 reported that Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen had arranged to pay porn star Stormy Daniels real name Stephanie Clifford 130000 in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in July of 2006 in Lake Tahoe Nevada one year after Trump had married Melania and four months after she gave birth to Barron Trump Cohen did not address the rumored payout but said in a statement that both Trump and Clifford denied the allegation Cohen provided a statement from Clifford in which she denied the allegations of a payout writing My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more When I met Donald Trump he was gracious professional and a complete gentleman to me and EVERYONE in my presence Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump trust me you wouldnt be reading about in the news you would be reading about it in my book But the fact of the matter is these stories are not true Developments While Clifford denied the allegations stories confirming the affair had been circulating in media well before the Wall Street Journals report CNN2 reported that Fox News reporter Diana Falzone had submitted the story to Fox News editors in October of 2016 and had the story corroborated by Cliffords manager Gina Rodriguez but Fox News never ran the story claiming they could never verify it The New York Times3 reported that Jacob Weisberg editor in chief of the Slate Group confirmed that Clifford had interviewed with Slate between August and October of 2016 about the affair and confirmed that Cohen had agreed to pay her 130000 for her silence However before Slate ran the story Clifford ceased communication with the publication Furthermore InTouch4 has an interview from 2011 in which Clifford confirmed the sexual encounter Their evidence confirming Cliffords truthfulness includes corroborations by Daniels friend Randy Spears and her exhusband Mike Moz Clifford also took and passed a polygraph test at the time of the interview According to sources familiar with the matter InTouch will be running the unedited 5500word interview they conducted with Clifford which includes details of Trumps performance in bed and pillow talk Another portion of the interview which generated headlines is a section where Clifford says We had really good banter He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with beautiful smart just like his daughter referring to Ivanka Trump cover shown below The story has been covered by multiple major news publications including Mother Jones5 Daily Beast6 and Twitter Moments7 InTouch Interview On January 18th 2018 InTouch magazine posted the unedited transcript of Cliffords interview with them from 2011 about her affair with Donald Trump8 Clifford described Trumps performance in bed as textbook generic though she described him as nice in their conversation beforehand and that he attempted to get her on The Apprentice According to Clifford afterwards Trump attempted to contact her several times to initiate more hook ups but it never worked out One of the stories in the interview that caught the attention of media organizations was Trumps intense fandom of Discovery Channels Shark Week After meeting with Clifford to let her know he could not get her on The Apprentice she alleges he was glued to watching Shark Week The strangest thing about that night  this was the best thing ever You could see the television from the little dining room table and he was watching Shark Week and he was watching a special about the USS something and it sank and it was like the worst shark attack in history He is obsessed with sharks Terrified of sharks He was like I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks I hope all the sharks die He was like riveted He was like obsessed Its so strange I know The Shark Week anecdote was covered by Uproxx9 and The Daily Dot10 Forbes Magazine Spanking Rumor The same day the InTouch interview was published Mother Jones11 posted an article about emails from 2009 they had uncovered from political advisors to Clifford Andrea Dub and a second anonymous consultant who exchanged anecdotes about Cliffords alleged sexual encounter with Trump In addition to the Shark Week anecdote one of the consultants says Clifford told them that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes Magazine The anonymous consultant further alleges that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes magazine with himself on the cover Mother Jones identified a 2006 issue of Forbes featuring Donald Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr on the cover as the possible magazine in question Michael Cohens Delaware LLC According to a report published by the Wall Street Journal12 on January 18th Michael Cohen used private company Essential Consultants LLC to pay Clifford 130000 on October 17th 2016 two weeks prior to the election The report alleges Cohen and Clifford used pseudonyms to complete the transaction Common Cause Complaints On January 22nd 2018 political watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of complaints to the Justice Department and Federal Elections Commission that the alleged 130000 sum paid to Clifford two weeks prior to the election amounted to an inkind campaign donation that was illegally undisclosed on official reports of the Trump campaigns finances13 They argue that because the money was paid so as not to damage the chances of Trump in the general election they should be considered campaign money An attorney for Common Cause Paul Ryan not to be confused with House Speaker Paul Ryan compared the situation to to the events that led to North Carolina senator John Edwards prosecution over 1 million he paid to cover up an affair he had with videographer Rielle Hunter14 Edwards was acquitted of the charges Republican campaign finance lawyer Jan Baran countered Common Causes argument saying that in both Trumps and Edwards cases money spent for a candidate is not necessarily money spent for a campaign and therefore is not a regulated contribution or expenditure Both times the purpose of the expense was highly personal to say the least and not campaign related in the legal sense On January 22nd Citizens For Ethics tweeted that the Trump campaign transferred 130000 to Trump businesses sarcastically suggesting it was probably just coincidence shown below Daniels Kimmel Appearance On January 30th 2018 Clifford as Daniels released a statement of denial of an affair with Trump The letter was posted by Buzzfeed News editor Tom Namako on Twitter16 after it was acquired by investigations reporter Anthony Cormier shown below The text of the statement reads To Whom It May Concern Over the past few weeks I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship I had with Donald Trump many many many years ago The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006 20011 sic 2016 2017 and now again in 2018 I am not denying this affair because I was paid hush money as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids I am denying this affair because it never happened I will have no further comment on this matter Please feel free to check me out on Instagram at thestormydaniels Thank you Stormy Daniels Later that evening she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss the allegations During the interview Kimmel noticed the signature on the statement did not look like Daniels signatures on other documents Kimmel provided When Kimmel bluntly asked if she had signed the document Daniels replied I dont know did I and also said That does not look like my signature The interview continued in this fashion with Daniels giving noncommittal answers leading Kimmel to conclude that she may have signed a nondisclosure agreement shown below Later that evening Cormier tweeted a response from Daniels lawyer who stated that Stormy did indeed sign both denials  I thought stormy did a fantastic job on Jimmy Kimmel tonight She was having fun on Kimmel and being her normal playful self17 The story was covered by Daily Dot18 and Uproxx19 Michael Cohens Admission On February 13th 2018 The New York Times20 reported that Michael Cohen admitted in a statement to them that hed paid Stormy Daniels the rumored sum of 130000 dollars He claimed he did this out of his own pocket and was not reimbursed for the payment and it was not a campaign expenditure He said the Trump Campaign and Trump Organization were not a aware of the transaction Cohen still argued that the affair didnt happen saying Just because something isnt true doesnt mean that it cant cause you harm or damage I will always protect Mr Trump He then refused to answer the Times followup questions including whether Mr Trump had been aware that Mr Cohen made the payment why he made the payment or whether he had made similar payments to other people over the years Cohen said he made a similar statement to the Federal Elections Commission and that the complaint made by Common Cause that the payment acted as a sort of inkind campaign contribution had no legal basis He stated he would not make further comment regarding the matter News organizations were skeptical of Cohens excuse CNN21 wrote that the explanation didnt pass the smell test writing Dont overthink it Cohen  out of the goodness of his heart  dropped a sixfigure payment to a porn star even though he didnt believe her allegations that she and the President had an affair after the birth of his son Barron I mean come on The Washington Post22 found that Cohens lack of denial that Trump had anything to do with the payment was a potential implication of the President in the deal They raised the possibility that Cohens language left room for interpretation that he had been a middle man in a larger transaction and suggested it was highly doubtful that Cohen would make such a payment without Trump knowing about the transaction Daniels Lawsuit Against Donald Trump In a lawsuit filed March 6th 2018 to a Los Angeles court23 Daniels claims the hush agreement she had with Trump is nonbinding because Trump never signed the document Attached to the lawsuit is the full hush agreement negotiated between Trump Daniels and Cohen The agreement uses pseudonymsTrumps pseudonym is David Dennison and Daniels is Peggy Peterson A side letter agreement reveals the true names David Dennison did not sign the agreement as Peggy Peterson had on October 28th 2016 Because of this omission Daniels believes she is free to discuss the affair she had with Trump The inclusion of Trump in the agreement undermines Cohens claim that he had paid the hush money out of his own pocket without Trumps knowledge24 Additionally the lawsuit came one day after The Wall Street Journal25 reported that Cohens payment to Daniels was marked as suspicious by the Treasury Department and that Cohen had privately complained that he had not been reimbursed for the hush money The morning of March 7th Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti appeared on The Today Show to discuss the lawsuit He alleged that Daniels and Trump did have an affair and argued it was ludicrous for Cohen to suggest Trump did not know about the payment Watch savannahguthriea39s full interview with Michael Avenatti Stormy Daniels lawyer a hrefhttpstco8koWFXvYh1pictwittercom8koWFXvYh1apmdash TODAY TODAYshow March 7 2018 The news led to several popular Reddit threads2728 with one gaining over 40000 upvotes26 The news also was posted to Twitter Moments29 the following morning A hearing for the lawsuit is set to be heard in the Los Angeles Supreme Court on July 12th 2018 Bubba the Love Sponge Clem Interview On March 14th 2018 CNN32 reported that Daniels had appeared on a 2007 radio show in Florida with local host Bubba the Love Sponge Clem in which she discussed her affair with Donald Trump Clem played segments from the interview on his show on March 9th and March 12th Though neither Clem nor Daniels mentioned Trump by name the details in the interview align with details Daniels provided about her affair with Trump CNN verified Clems assertion that Daniels was talking about Trump Daniels Crowdfunding Campaign On March 13th 2018 Daniels launched a crowdfunding campaign on CrowdJustice30 for legal fees for her lawsuit against Trump In her statement on CrowdJustice Daniels wrote that she offered to return the 130000 of hush money she received from Michael Cohen in order to be able to speak freely of her affair with Trump Cohen did not acknowledge the offer She also accuses Cohen of threatening her with a 1 million fine for every time she spoke openly about Trump She requests funds for attorneys fees outofpocket costs associated with the lawsuit arbitration and my right to speak openly security expenses and damages that may be awarded against me if I speak out and ultimately lose to Mr Trump and Mr Cohen The campaign was covered by The Daily Beast31 60 Minutes Interview On March 25th 2018 CBS 60 Minutes aired an interview with Daniels in which she detailed her affair with Trump32 In the interview Daniels detailed how their meetings were consensual but she was never attracted to Trump She described the affair as practically a business deal She went into detail about the methods with which Trump associates threatened her to keep her from talking about the affair confirmed the rumor that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes magazine and also confirmed the rumor that Trump had said she reminded him of his daughter Ivanka Internet users joked about the more salacious details of the interview and also remarked that the interviewer Anderson Cooper appeared as though he were trying not to laugh during the interview Twitter reactions were shared under the hashtag StormyDanielsDay33 and were covered by Uproxx32 Dilated Pupils Conspiracy Theory Following the 60 Minutes interview some online claimed that Daniels was high on drugs during the taping citing her pupils which appeared to be dilated as evidence Twitter34 user j3nnp4c3 tweeted at Danielss lawyer Michael Avenatti a closeup picture of Daniels during the interview shown below left with the caption I would urge your client to lay off the crack while on tv Even the bright lights couldnt shrink those coked out pupils Twitter35 user mjgranger1 also posted a picture shown below center with the caption 60Minutes Stormy Daniels pupils are so large even with bright lights in her face you cant see her iriss Can you say medication realDonaldTrump Conspiracy theorist Mark Dice tweeted35 a variation of the Cocaine Marijuana Beer meme with Danielss eyes in the first box He captioned the post Whats up with this floozy Stormy Daniels massively dilated pupils during her 60 Minutes interview The post shown below right received more than 1100 retweets and 2300 likes in two days This theory has been debunked because there is no way to to know for sure what caused her pupils dilate Studies show the pupils dilate because of emotional changes or memory which is a more common reason for pupil dilation than drugs37 When people attempt to retrieve an old memory or remembering an old question both processes that an interviewee undergoes their pupils can dilate Assistant professor at LSU Megan Papesh said It is absolutely wrong to assume that someone is on drugs legal or illegal based on dilated pupils  There is simply no way to know for sure what caused her pupils to dilate Being interviewed for 60 Minutes is surely exciting or nervewracking and both of those would reasonably cause dilation Several media outlets covered the conspiracy theory including The Daily Dot38 Business Insider The Daily Mail39 and more Michael Cohen Raided by FBI On April 9th 2018 the FBI raided Michael Cohens office and New York City hotel room seizing business records emails and documents related to the Stormy Daniels case40 In a statement Cohens lawyer Stephen Ryan said he was told by federal prosecutors that the action was in part a referral by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller Donald Trump spoke to reporters about the raid later that day criticizing the ongoing FBI investigation as a witchhunt criticized Attorny General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russiagate investigation and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and once again floated the idea of firing Robert Mueller41 Federal guidelines suggest Rosenstein would have approved the raid The following morning Trump tweeted Attorneyclient privilege is dead and A TOTAL WITCH HUNT shown below It is unclear as of April 10th what the FBI hopes to find and what information they had to prompt the raid Former US Attorney Preet Bahara who served in the Southern District of New York was quoted as saying Its being done because people think its very serious people think its totally warranted and people think theres evidence of a significant enough nature that youre going to risk doing something sensitive like raiding a law office42 Sketch of Man Who Threatened Stormy Daniels On April 17th 2018 while appearing on The View Daniels released a police sketch of a man who she claims threatened her to keep silent about Donald Trump shown below Twitter user yashar

federal judge in California66 dismissed the lawsuit stating Trumps tweet was protected by the First Amendment If this court were to prevent Mr Trump from engaging in this type of rhetorical hyperbole

defamation The decision also included the demand that Daniels pay Trumps legal fees On Twitter Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti announced his plan to appeal the decision to the 9th Circuit Court of

shown below right received more than 9000 retweets and 30000 likes in 24 hours Giuliani and Trump Admit to Payout On May 1st 2018 Rudy Giuliani who was recently hired by President Trump to be one of his lawyers appeared on Sean Hannity and confirmed that Trump had reimbursed the 130000 hush money Michael Cohen made to Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 Presidential Election However he did so out of his personal funds and did not do so with campaign money or money from the Trump Organization quote shown below5253 Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman 130000 I mean which is going to turn out to be perfectly legal That money was not campaign money sorry Im giving you a fact now that you dont know Its not campaign money No campaign finance violation They funneled through a law firm and the president repaid it Sean everybody was nervous about this from the very beginning I wasnt I knew how much money Donald Trump put into that campaign and I said 130000 He could do a couple of checks for 130000 When I heard of Cohens retainer of 35000 when he was doing no work for the president I said thats how hes repaying  thats how hes repaying it with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael He didnt know about the specifics of the arrangement as far as I know But he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this This directly contradicted a statement Trump made in April in which he said he had no knowledge of the payment Cohen made to Daniels54 In a followup interview with The Washington Post55 Giuliani confirmed that him saying the President had repaid the money was not an accident and that hed planned with Trump to say what he did in a public forum Costa So the president is not angry with what you said tonight He was well aware youd bring it up Giuliani Oh yeah yeah Sure sure He was well aware that at some point when I saw the opportunity I was going to get this over with Costa Is that what you had talked about with him in recent days Giuliani Probably four or five days ago Following the interview Trump tweeted a statement admitting to the payment and reaffirmed the payment did not come from campaign money56 The three tweets read Mr Cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as a nondisclosure agreement or NDA These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms Clifford Daniels The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair Prior to its violation by Ms Clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement Money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction Twitter users noticed that the date of the payment October 27th 2016 came the day before the bombshell James Comey Letter about Hillary Clintons Email Investigation which came out two weeks before the election and arguably played a large role in its outcome Giuliani appeared to be aware of the upcoming Comey Letter when he appeared on Fox News on October 26th and said We got a couple things up our sleeve that should turn this around57 Twitter users argued that the timing of the payment made could possibly make it a legal issue as if the payment had political motivations the fact it was not disclosed could still violate campaign finance law Online Redditors took to memeing the interview by grabbing a screenshot where Giuliani appeared surprised A post on

court documents the detectives then approached the stage and Daniels shoved two of their faces into her breasts and smacked them in the face with her breasts This led to three misdemeanor charges against Daniels who then posted her 6000 bail and the charges were dropped Thursday morning according to Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti Avenatti tweeted that he suspected the arrest was politically

numerous discussions about Daniels appearance in Columbus Ohio days before her arrest The emails definitely show that the police lied about it being a prostitution and human trafficking mission said the whistleblower In a July 12th email one officer wrote Youre WelcomeThank me in person later That day Danielss lawyer Michael Avenatti tweeted This is extremely disturbing I intend on getting to

cheat to win Celebrity Apprentice and offers the opinion that when she knew him there was nothing that made him seem as petulant and prone to tantrums as he has been as president Daniels attorney

central role in the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal They came to the conclusion after interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them as well as court papers corporate records and other documents68 The Wall Street Journal found that Trump was briefed or involved in every step of the process and the US attorneys office in Manhattan gathered evidence of Trumps participation Tapes found in the Michael Cohen raid reveal conversations between Cohen and Trump in which Trump agreed to pay Karen McDougal 150000 as well as discussions for the Stormy Daniels payment The Wall Street journal recounts Um I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so thatIm going to do that right away said Mr Cohen according to a copy of the audio file As Mr Cohen explained his plans Mr Trump spoke over him So what are we gonna payOnefifty Mr Trump asked Mr Cohen paused and replied Yes The report contradicts Trumps repeated denial that he was involved with the payments and raised questions about whether he committed campaign finance law DanielsAvenatti Dispute On November 28th 2018 Stormy Daniels told the Daily Beast69 that her attorney Michael Avenatti had filed the defamation suit against Donald Trump without her consent Additionally she told the outlet that Avenatti had ignored her requests for information on her two crowdfunding campaigns She said Im tremendously grateful to Avenatti for aggressively representing me in my fight to regain my voice But in other ways Michael has not treated me with the respect and deference an attorney should show to a client He has spoken on my behalf without my approval He filed a defamation case against Donald Trump against my wishes He repeatedly refused to tell me how my legal defense fund was being spent Now he has launched a new crowdfunding campaign using my face and name without my permission and attributing words to me that I never wrote or said Legal experts have noted that if Avenatti had filed suit without Danielss knowledge he could be sued for malpractice Avenatti disputed the claims made by Daniels explaining how the money was being spent He wrote I am and have always been Stormys biggest champion I have personally sacrificed an enormous amount of money time and energy toward assisting her because I believe in her I have always been an open book with Stormy as to all aspects of her cases and she knows that The retention agreement Stormy signed back in February provided that she would pay me 10000 and that any and all other monies raised via a legal fund would go toward my legal fees and costs Instead the vast majority of the money raised has gone toward her security expenses and similar other expenses The most recent campaign was simply a refresh of the prior campaign designed to help defray some of Stormys expenses Stormy Daniels AVN Awards Appearance On January

  <textRepresentation>Steamed Hams is a memorable skit between Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers on the animated sitcom The Simpsons The scene has been a popular reference point for fans who have recontextualized quotes from the skit making it the frequent subject of shitposting on Facebook and YouTube Origin Steamed Hams comes from a scene in the Simpsons episode 22 Short Films About Springfield which first aired on April 14th 19961 In the episode which is an anthology of 22 short scenes about several of the citizens of Springfield the character Principal Skinner has Superintendent Chalmers over for dinner in a play on the dinner with the boss sitcom trope shown below2 The dinner as per the trope does not go according to plan as Skinner burns dinner leading him to cover the truth about dinner through elaborate and increasingly unbelievable series of lies After burning dinner and telling Chalmers that hes making steamed clams for dinner Skinner attempts to convince Chalmers that what he had prepared steamed hams for dinner an expression for hamburgers he says which is native to Albany New York3 Principal Skinner Superintendent I hope youre ready for mouthwatering hamburgers Superintendent Chalmers I thought we were having steamed clams Principal Skinner Oh no I said steamed hams Thats what I call hamburgers Superintendent Chalmers You call hamburgers steamed hams Principal Skinner Yes its a regional dialect Superintendent Chalmers Uhhuh What region Principal Skinner Uh upstate New York Superintendent Chalmers Really Well Im from Utica and I never heard anyone use the phrase steamed hams Principal Skinner Oh not in Utica no its an Albany expression Superintendent Chalmers I see While the line has been quoted by fans since the

start making spitting sounds followed by a mob like mentality Unsuspecting VRchat users fall victim to Ugandan Knuckles promise of showing de wey Only followed by a mass trolling Origin On August 7th

the users of VRChat Please do not use this to bug the users of Vrchat Its community means a lot to me and it would hurt me to see the rights of other users taken away and possibly restricted because of how out of hand it can get Showing off their creativity and what they are capable of For me Im in college and dont have a lot of time to get on like I would like to anymore I remember making this and thinking Well it could be funny to show off to my friends and possibly mess with users But Ive learned what kind of things Im really capable of making Its always fun to be the one with models no one else has access to Because I can make anything that I want to be Its like Its like that special place for me To get away from the real world and be someone Im not But right now Vrchat has become a meme ground and I feel I have helped to dig a grave for Vrchat Soon enough people are gunna get tired of all the memes that now pollute the servers And with 500 people trying to just enjoy an event they cant because there just isnt enough moderation to hold down the rampant amounts of memers So please Think about the users that youre playing with Before they are all gone Dont let it be a second Second Life The following day Ebaumsworld5 published an article title Ugandan Knuckles Creator Says The Meme Has Gotten Out Of Hand The tidiestflyer update was subsequently removed Racism Accusations

  <textRepresentation>Flat Earth Theory is a hypothesis that states that there is no true evidence that the earth is round While the hypothesis is often dismissed as a weak easily disproved theory several different organizations online boast subscribers to the hypothesis who enjoy discussing whether or not the earth is flat Origin People have believed that the Earth is flat since the beginning of humanity but the modern Flat Earth hypothesis stemmed from an experiment called the Bedford Level Experiment conducted in the mid1800s by a man named Samuel Rowbotham1 Rowbowtham who wrote a book named Earth Not a Globe started the modern movement by debating scientists publicly and accumulating followers In the experiment Rowbowtham attempted to measure the curvature of the earth by observing the curvatures at a local river He took his results as disproving the theory of a round earth but future scientists have said that the results he obtained could be accounted for by the parallax effect2 A drawing from Rowbowthams experiment In 1956 Samuel Shenton created a more modern version of the Flat Earth Society to collect a variety of followers of Rowbowthams experiments When the first images of the earth taken from space were released Shenton claimed that they were false In the 1970s and 1980s they released a newsletter called the Flat Earth News which often debated NASA and other space agencies Spread In 2004 the society was resurrected by a man named Daniel Shenton no relation to Samuel who created the Flat Earth Society forum which as of February 2016 has over 8200 members and 14 million posts3 In addition the forum runs a Facebook page with over 14000 likes4 Twitter5 Instagram6 and Tumblr profiles with several thousand followers each and a Flickr profile7 where they advertise a variety of different posters with proofs for why the world is flat In addition a variety of independent researchers have attempted to prove that the earth is flat documenting their work in YouTube videos8 The most popular of these videos shown below has over 4 million views BoB vs Neil DeGrasse Tyson On January 25th 2016 Atlanta rapper BoB who has selfidentified as a member of the Flat Earth Society tweeted a photograph of himself against a skyline then tweeted a screenshot from Flat Earth Movement literature that proclaimed that Polaris the North Star can be seen 20 south of the Equator Neil DeGrasse Tyson answered the rappers question writing Polaris is gone by 15 deg S Latitude Youve never been south of Earths Equator or if so youve never looked up Later that day BoB posted the track Flatline to his Soundcloud account dissing the physicist and reinforcing his belief in a flat earth Other Celebrity Followers In January 2016 Tila Tequila posted a series of tweets claiming to believe the Earth is flat The following month on February 16th 2016 NBA super star Kyrie Irving expressed his belief that the Earth is flat on the podcast Road Trippin shown below left The next year in 2017 famed JiuJitsu instructor and former UFC analyst Eddie Bravo came forward with his belief in a flat Earth numerous times most notably on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast shown below right

and your work Thomas Astruc for the people who may not know you Thomas Astruc Im Thomas Astruc 41 creator and director of Miraculous Ladybug I live in Paris and I love superheroes cats and cooking 3K Did you expect Miraculous Ladybug to get the popularity it did TA We all thought yeah the show should work fine but we didnt expect it to be this successful all around the world and especially this fast 3K What about your show do you think made it a success TA Probably because Miraculous is all about good vibes Some people may think the show is corny but I believe that such positivity is very refreshing and helps to deal with hard times I also think that people can feel that theres a deep mythology hidden in the show and that theyve only seen glimpses of it so far which makes them curious And of course the romance 3K How enjoyable of an experience is it to know that the cartoons you have worked on are enjoyed not only in your native France but in many other countries around the globe TA Im very happy to be able to share our culture with the rest of the world and hopefully that people get to love France a little bit more Im also very happy to see that Miraculous bring people together no matter the nationality or the age Thats all an artist can hope for 3K How has the success of the show and its increasing fanbase impacted your life if any TA Well its like Christmas comes on a daily basis now I receive a lot of mails and packages from fans I apologize for not being able to answer to each and every one of them I cant thank them enough These last years were exhausting Their love and support really helped then and still helps now 3K Do you think that French animation has become a bit of a stronger force in the animation world in the past few years TA I think so We started to build an animation industry at the end of the eighties decades after US and Japan And now we are the 3rd biggest country for animation But we still lack of visibility When people watch our shows its difficult for them to guess where it comes from Partially because we dont have distinctive style like japanese animation or big motion pictures powerhouses owning big properties like America has But mostly because unlike US and Japan our animation industry is not used to create synergies with video games comics and merchandising But we will improve We can count on our strengths we have great schools great artists big up to the Miraculous team and we are at the crossroad of many cultures 3K What are your opinions on the current quality of animation both western and eastern TA Were very lucky to have so much quality animation these days wherever it comes from My only concern is for japanese industry who reached a point where it needs to open up internationally but seems struggle with this I hope theyll succeed 3K Favorite part of the fanbase TA They can be writers artists cosplayers musicians or fans who simply enjoy the show I love them all They are so nice and always spread positivity They really captured the essence of the show 3K As a database referencing internet culture we would like to ask you this what do you think of the trends that have spawned from your show and from yourself such as the phrase No spoiler or the original characters that the fans are making both hero and villain TA Is Miraculous trendy I dont realize All I can say is that Miraculous seems to get a life on its own outside the show which is great because it means it has made its way to peoples heart 3K Do you have any tips for aspiring animators in the world TA Two things First storytelling above all Second you dont work for yourself but for the others 3K Do you have anything you want to add to the readers at Know Your Meme TA Try and be nice to people avoid eating fat read a good book every now and then get some walking in and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations Big up to those who guess where this quotation comes from and bigger up to those who live by it Love Search Interest External References 1 Twitter  Thomas Astruc 2 Crunchyroll  VIDEO Toei Animation and French Company ZAGToon Collaborate on Lady Bug 3 IMDb  Miraculous Ladybug

  <textRepresentation>Clock Man is a stopmotion animated Czech short which aired on Nickelodeons Pinwheel show This short follows the story of a girl who is taken on an unpleasant trip by a mysterious clock man but is returned to her room just before sunriseFor years discussions about the film circulated online despite no official record of its existence with some dismissing the story as a creepypasta In midDecember 2017 the film was discovered by The Lost Media Wiki as the short animated film About Dressy Sally Origin In 2012 The Flood Forums member Commander Santa submitted a thread about his search for a short film aired on Nickelodeons Pinwheel show he remembered from his childhood that continued to haunt him for years to come Commander Santa described the short as follows This short animation was terrifying as a child The scene is still burned into my mind 28 years later Its of a young boy sleeping in his bed Above his bed is a ticking clock All the lights in the room are off and it is very dark Suddenly the clock begins to slow down its ticking and eventually it stopson midnight When the clock stops a GreenishBluish man climbs out of the clock The boy wakes up just in time to see this man dressed in black grab him out of bed and kidnap him by carrying him through a window The Clock Man takes the boy on some kind of terrifying adventure and brings him back to his bed before sunrise Commander Santa also provided a sketch of what he remembered about the shortshown below Initially fellow users were skeptical as Commander Santas story felt eerily creepypastalike especially when compared to Candle Cove But with Commander Santa being a highly respected member of the forums many tried to help in any way they could In the first 24 hours the thread received over 800 replies and several suggestions to what the animated short could have been Spread Stories about the short film subsequently spread to other online communities including 4chans x paranormal board the World of Warcraft TV Forums Hippotank Minecraft Forums Yahoo Answers and the Bioware Social Network Commander Santa subsequently consulted various cartoon collectors and universities including the National Film and Television School Vancouver Film School University of California Arizona State Cornell and Brigham Young University Lost Media Wiki Search On September 16th 2016 The Lost Media Wiki a website associated with the research and seeking of pieces of media considered lost due to the difficulty of finding them announced a shift in focus to the search of Clock Man specifically after the conclusion of its previous main focus A Day With Spongebob Squarepants That day YouTubers BedHead Bernie and Dycate released videos detailing the search up to that point That same day the Lost Media Wiki released an infographic detailing information known about the short shown below Discovery On December 10th 2017 LMW user NitrateNerd announced in the forums that he had possibly discovered the film6 Many users found it to be similar enough to be a lead and the next day the Lost Media Wiki confirmed that they in fact have discovered the short film which was a 1976 animation by director Dagmar Doubkov The cartoon had been uploaded to YouTube by the AAA Studio  Animated movies in September shown below5 Finally on December 21st 2017 Commander Santa confirmed that the discovered short was indeed the Clock Man short that he had been searching for all those years and had promised to donate the 1000 reward he offered for its discovery to the Lost Media Wiki7 The forum post is as follows Id like everyone to know the INCREDIBLE effort dycaite and his team at Lost Media wiki have put in over the last 5 years Way back in 2012 I was a member of the Bungienet forums LATE one night I decided to make a post asking if anyone else remembered a certain video from the old Nickelodeon show Pinwheel I had stayed home from school one day and was sick on the couch when the creepiest thing I ever saw came on TV It was a short cartoon that gave me a serious case of the heebiegeebies After posting my story it exploded The story spread across multiple websites like fire After about a week of searching by MANY people this included contacting Viacom a college in Canada and various reps at Nickelodeon the internet deemed me a troll and a liar This story is made up Santa is a troll Weve all been lied to I spent hours and hours every night for months trying to find this one short I couldnt remember the name to The name I gave it was Clockman because of the image I remembered of the man creepily coming out of a clock Fast forward 13 years later and dycaite and his crew of media detectives have finally located The Clockman Later today I plan on returning back to the bnet forums with proof of Clockmans exisitence thanks to dycaite I cannot thank him enough Not only did he track down Clockman but he was able to locate me too hiding out here on Nintendoage Id HIGHLY suggest anyone looking for a lost media bounty hunter to speak with dycaite If they can find Clockman they can find anything Heres the video that was previously thought to be destroyed that dycaite and his crew were able to pull from the media grave for anyone who is interested Thanks again 1 million times dycaite You are amazing Search Interest External References 1 The Flood  Original Clock

  <textRepresentation>The Undertaker Threw Mankind Off Hell in a Cell is a copypasta often seen on Reddit and Facebook which is typically altered to fit the context of the post it is responding to Redditor shittymorph is often credited with popularizing the message within various subreddits Cnet wrote an article about Shittymorph and his development of the meme Origin Many cite Redditor shittymorph with creating the copypasta In an article with CNET13 explaining how the meme was started he cited seeing the comment in an unrelated Facebook post This may have been a post on the NFL Memes Facebook page published on January 8th 2017 where it was posted by Curtis Ortner7 Spread On January 19th 2017 Redditor shittymorph replied to a post on rpics6 highlighting a portrait of Salt Bae made out of salt urging readers dont let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcers table On February 6th 2017 Redditor ScienceLivesInsideMe replied to a photograph of a dog on the raww1 subreddit with Scooby Doothemed variation of the copypasta In response Redditor shittymorph replied explaining that the message was something he had been posting for weeks It is something I have been posting for a few weeks  I usually adjust the statement to whatever the post is related to I have been getting a laugh out of doing it and other people have seemed to enjoy it too  Anyway  since this is my post and I have been going around making variations of this comment people are now showing up here on my post with their own variations of the comment I hope that clarifies things but please do not let this extensive clarification distract you from the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcers table2 The following day Redditor pujolsrox11 submitted a post asking about the copypasta meme to rOutOfTheLoop4 On Februrary 11th shittymorph

Lisa Joy did an Ask Me Anything for Reddit rama subreddit about the show11 Responding to the question Oh hi Lisa With the show renewed for a third season how far ahead have you already planned the story Do you work on it one season at a time or is there a general idea you are slowly developing Thanks Joy gave a long answer which culminated in her recreating the copypasta answer which features spoilers for Westworld below The reply gained over 9300 points Our philosophy from the beginning was to lay out the major tentpole moments  Fords death Doloress transformation Bernards discovery and all the moments coming down the line  while working on the pilot We needed to plan out the journey for several seasons in order to know where to begin But obviously you cant  and wouldnt want to  plan everything But then you dont want to be dogmatic about it If you find a storyline or a character situation that you didnt expect you want to have the latitude to lean into that This is especially true with character pairings which are really where it gets fun with such a large ensemble You take two great flavors and add them together to make a new dish So Maeve and Lee in season 2 Dolores and Hector season 3 MIB and Akecheta season 4 etc But you have to start at the beginning And for us the ultimate meaning of this story the destination our path has always been leading started back in nineteen ninetyeight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off hll in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table Uproxxs prowrestling section12 covered the use of the copypasta writing a humorous article investigating the implications of if professional wrestler Mick Foley and his various different characters were tied to the plot of the series On June 23rd Redditor Shittymorph posted a picture of a gift package sent to him by the WWE for his contributions to the meme as well as to mark the 20th anniversary of the match between The Undertaker and Mankind In December 2018 online game Hearthstone released a character card named Da Undatakah The flavor text on the card directly quotes the meme In January 2019 the twitter account for the long running TV show Jeopardy

  <textRepresentation>Internet Slang consists of a number of different ways of speaking sublanguages expressions spelling techniques and idioms that have obtained most of their meaning on the Internet These different kinds of language can be either known as chatspeak15 SMS speak16 or IM language17 Types Intentional Misspellings Intentional misspellings may have stemmed from space restriction on instant messaging and SMS services including Twitter However some of these misspellings have come from accidental typographical errors that have been embraced by the community One example of this is Teh an error when typing The Deliberate usage of Teh dates back to the late 1990s in realtime gaming chats and IRC channels and was later popularized as a term in LOLspeak Phonetic Translation Coming straight from SMS language this is a way of replacing entire words or bits of words by their phonetic equivalent embodied into single letters or figures and it is often found in 1337speak Many memes tend to reuse these terms on their own as can be seen by examples such as In Ur base or LOLcats Disemvoweling Disemvoweling19 is the practice of removing all vowels from a token word and is also found in SMSIM language The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog would after being disemvowelled look like this Th qck brwn fx jmps vr th lzy dg Leetspeak 1337speak consists of replacing a letter by its closest figures lookalike or by using various keyboard signs such as     _ and more to recreate that letter A Russian form of 1337speak known as Padonkaffsky jargon or Olbanian18 also exists and a Filipino equivalent known as Jejemon emerged in 2010 Letter Repetition More than a slang it symbolizes a type of language often pointed as being used by teenagers consisting of the same letter in a word repeated several times for emphasis Other spelling phenomena has been derived from it such as 111oneeleven as an ironic way to replace an exclamation mark or FUUUUUU to express great frustration and coming directly from Rageguy Acronyms and Initialisms Acronyms20 the art of creating a neology through the association of letters and initials between them exist on the Internet since the late 1980s Starting with LOL from laughing out loud and used to convey great hilarity hundreds of others have been made since then Among them can be found  OMG BRB RTFM SMH GOAT and tldr Idioms The Internet is also the cradle of many expressions whose complete meanings can only be acknowledge and understood because of or in relation to the Internet While some of them are used as synonymous of another word the way Over 9000 can be viewed as a replacement in expressing lots or bucketload the same way win and fail are respectively meaning success and failure others have their own meaning such as DERP as a way to signify stupidity or also Fag as a suffix which has a totally different meaning and doesnt necessarily address homosexuals in a derogatory way Academic Research researching

  <textRepresentation>The Internet Archive is a digital library and archival site dedicated to permanent documentation of and free public access to a wide variety of digital artifacts ranging rom websites and music to videos and nearly three million books registered under public domain History The Internet Archive1 was founded in 1996 by American computer engineer and Internet activist Brewster Kahle2 who also cofounded the web crawling service Alexa Internet around the same time It initially began as Kahles personal project to archive the World Wide Web Netnews Bulletin Board System and other publicly available software and webpages but by late 1999 its scope had been expanded to include other worthy archive collections like the Prelinger Archives and the NASA Images Archive Kahles collection was largely kept private on digital tape throughout the 1990s only allowing researchers and scientists to access the database on special occasions Despite its lack of public access the Internet Archives was met by press coverage from several US news publications upon its launch including the New York Times Washington Post Wired Magazine and National Public Radio NPR The database eventually became available for public access on the fifth anniversary of the project in 2001 with the launch of The Wayback Machine3 a digital time capsule that allows its users to browse multiple versions of web pages archived over time According to Kahle4 he was inspired to create the Machine after visting the offices of nowdefunct search engine service Alta Vista and witnessing the companys ambitious plan to store and index everything that was on the web Throughout the 2000s the Internet Archive continued to expand its collection by merging preexisting databases as well as building new ones SOPA  PIPA Protest On January 18th 2012 the Internet Archives blacked out its website for twelve hours in protest of the controversial US Internet bills Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act similar to many other resource websites and databases like Wikipedia 10 Petabytes Milestone In midOctober 2012 the project reached an important milestone5 of 10 petabytes 10000000000000000 bytes worth of digital materials in preservation including millions of digital books music movies and webpages San Francisco Office Fire On November 5th 2013 Internet Archives office in San Francisco California caught fire destroying approximately 600000 worth of digital scanning equipment and damaging an adjacent apartment complex shown below According to the official blog post19 no injuries were reported from the scene and the scope of damage was mostly limited to equipments albeit costly with some losses of physical materials that were being digitized in the scanning room In the blog post the Internet Archive also announced an emergency fund drive20 to rebuild its scanning capabilities and called on digitization services to help the group continue its archiving process throughout the recovery Features The Internet Archives is mainly comprised of its free online services Wayback Machine and ArchiveIt in addition to a number of specialized media collections that have been acquired over time most notably the Prelinger Archives NASA Image Archives Open Library and Live Music Archive this section is currently being researched The Wayback Machine The Wayback Machine is the Internet Archives threedimensional index service that allows its user to search browse and access snapshots of the World Wide Web archived through its database over time Since its launch in 2001 millions of websites and their associated data and media have been archived by the service which can be used to learn more about what previous versions of certain websites used to look like to grab source code that have disappeared from websites or to visit websites that no longer exist on the web Often considered a crucial academic research tool in studying the history of the Internet its popularity has also led to the synonymous usage of the terms Wayback Machine and Internet Archive in some online communities ArchiveIt ArchiveIt is a web archiving service that enables individuals and organizations to harvest catalog and preserve specialized collectons of digital media content in the archive format All of ArchiveIt partners collectons are also made publicly available with fulltext search and some of them may be periodically indexed into the Internet Archives general archive As of mid2011 the service had reached more than 180 partner institutions in 44 US states and 14 countries with over 27 billion URLs and 1534 public collections Open Library The Open Library is a free opensource software project which can be used to create a webbased database for every book ever published and archived It holds at least 23 million catalog records of books and approximately 16 million fullyreadable and downloadable books in the public domain Software Museum On April 13th 2013 TextFiles founder and archivist Jason Scott announced the launch of the Internet Archives Software Museum9 on his blog8 According to Scott the worlds largest software repository will serve as the host of smaller collections including shareware CDs10 emulators for a number of oldschool gaming consoles and computers11 classic PC games12 a mirror of the nowdefunct gaming site FilePlanet13 and the Tucows Software Library14 which boasts more than 33000 files in its collection Scott also noted that the Museums work is not completed as it still lacks the necessary metadata needed to easily browse through the archive The launch of the Software Museum was subsequently picked up by a number of tech news blogs such as Engadget15 Tuaw16 and VentureBeat17 The Console Living Room On December 26th the Internet Archive launched The Console Living Room21 archive for console games from several different consoles from the 1970s and 1980s including the Atari 2600 ColecoVision Magnavox Odyssey and

  <textRepresentation>Deep Web also known as Deepnet the Invisible Web the Undernet or the hidden Web are parts of the Internet that are not considered part of the surface web or the portion of the World Wide Web that is indexed by conventional search engines Many deep web sites are not indexed because they use dynamic databases that are devoid of hyperlinks and can only be found by performing an internal search query Origin According to The New York Times1 computer scientist Mike Bergman is credited with coining the term deep web in a paper titled The Deep Web Surfacing Hidden Value published in The Journal of Electronic Publishing2 in August of 2001 In the paper Bergman mentions that Internet business author Dr Jill Ellsworth coined the phrase invisible Web in 1994 when referring to websites that were not indexed by common search engines The paper also estimated that at the time of publication information on the deep Web was 400 to 550 times larger than the commonly defined World Wide Web or approximately 7500 terabytes of data Spread On May 29th 2001 librarian Robert Lackie launched the website Those Dark Hiding Places7 as a directory for sites that assist in navigating the deep Web On January 16th 2002 the website for Deep Web Technologies was launched which provides the proprietary Explorit client for deep web searching On March 25th 2003 the tech news blog Campus Technology8 published an article with links to resources for finding information on the deep Web On March 9th 2004 Salon9 published an article which argued that deep Web search engines have the potential to give the electorate a powerful lens into the public record On June 16th 2005 Wired10 reported that Yahoos Search Subscription service would allow users to search some subscription sites in the deep Web On December 18th 2006 the Online Education Database11published an Ultimate Guide to the Invisible Web providing background information and tips for navigating deep Web content On September 25th 2008 the DeepPeep4 search engine was started as a project at the University of Utah which aimed to crawl and index every database on the Internet including the deep Web As of January 2012 the search engine is not available On February 22nd 2009 The New York Times1 published an article about the challenges facing the Google search engine in crawling deep Web content Operation Darknet In October 2011 a group of Anonymous hacktivists launched Operation Darknet also known as OpDarknet which launched a series of distributed denialofservice DDoS attacks against Lolita City a deep Web child pornography website that is only accessible via the TOR anonymous web browser Freedom Hosting Network On August 1st 2013 the Federal Bureau of Investigations FBI arrested Eric Eoin Marques a 28yearold Irishman who owns and operates Freedom Hosting on Tor network on charges of distributing and promoting child abuse material online On the following day approximately half of Freedom Hostings hidden services reportedly suffered from malware attacks and taken offline many of which were suspected to host illegal activities including the criminal hacking site HackBB money laundering services and a vast portion of online child pornography researching Related Concepts TOR The Onion Router TOR is an anonymous browsing client which allows its users to browse the Internet anonymously by separating identification and routing thus concealing network activity from surveillance Some websites on the deep Web can only be accessed via the TOR client Silk Road The Silk Road is

  <textRepresentation>Net Neutrality is a network design principle and digital rights movement which advocates Internet service providers ISPs to treat all traffic on the Internet equally in order to maintain an open Internet The principle is in opposition to a closed Internet in which providers restrict access to content filter content or use traffic shaping3 to degrade access to specific web services Online History Although the basic concept of net neutrality is often credited with the open access movement and political activist Lawrence Lessig4 as early as 20012 the term was first coined by Columbia law professor Tim Wu in a 2003 paper titled Network Neutrality Broadband Discrimination1 The paper proposed that legislation be drafted to ensure ISPs allow unfettered communication between network applications and Quality of Service QoS traffic Principles of Network Freedom In February 2004 United States Federal Communications Commission FCC chairman Michael Powell announced a list of Network Freedom principles stating that consumers be given four freedoms including freedom to access content freedom to run applications freedom to attach devices and freedom to obtain service plan information6 On November 8th 2005 Google8 published a blog post containing a letter to Congress promoting net neutrality by computer scientist Vinton Cerf9 Dear Chairman Barton and Ranking Member Dingell I appreciate the inquiries by your staff about my availability to appear before the Committee and to share Googles views about draft telecommunications legislation and the issues related to network neutrality These are matters of great importance to the Internet and Google welcomes the Committees hard work and attention The hearing unfortunately conflicts with another obligation and I am sorry I will not be able to attend Along with my colleague Robert Kahn I am honored to be receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Wednesday at the White House for our work in creating the Internet protocol TCPIP Save The Internet In April 2006 the Save the Internet5 online activist organization was formed by the Free Press advocacy group which includes a coalition of businesses and

titled Save the Internets in which the electronic musician Moby attempts to confront uninterested people on the street about net neutrality shown below right Net Neutrality Squad On November 5th 2007 the Net Neutrality Squad10 activist group was formed to enlist Internet users to report any actions by ISPs deemed threatening to net neutrality On November 14th President Barack Obama gave an address at Google announcing his commitment to preserving network neutrality shown below left On June 8th 2008 YouTuber AtheneWins uploaded a video promoting the protection of net neutrality gaining upwards

management practices refrain from blocking any lawful content or discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic15 On April 23rd 2014 the FCC announced their proposal to change net neutrality rules to allow content companies to pay Internet service providers for special fast lanes that would deliver content at increased speeds17 The following day a petition was created on the White House website We the People19 urging the Obama administration to reject the FCCs plans to allow preferential treatment to content providers shown below On May 3rd Redditor dydorn submitted a post urging viewers to sign the petition and contact the FCC to fight the fast lane proposal to rtechnology18 where it received upwards of 12000 upvotes and 560 comments in the first 48 hours On May 5th YouTuber CGP Grey uploaded a video titled Internet Citizens Defend Net Neutrality which explained the basics of net neutrality and urged viewers to contact the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet as a title

Endorsement On November 10th 2014 The White House YouTube channel uploaded a video in which President Barack Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to do everything they can to protect net neutrality and classify home Internet as a public utility shown below That day Republican Senator Ted Cruz from Texas posted a tweet20 calling net neutrality Obamacare for the Internet shown below In the first 24 hours the tweet gained over 2700 retweets and 1200 favorites Many Twitter users mocked Ted Cruz for the tweet arguing that the comparison made little sense Also on November 10th The Oatmeal webcomic posted an explanation of net neutrality directed at Cruz shown below Reclassification of Broadband Access in the US On February 26th 2015 the Federal Communications Commission FCC21 voted 32 in favor of reclassifying broadband access as a telecommunications service under Title II thus recognizing highspeed Internet as a public utility and enabling the implementation of new federal regulations that strictly prohibit the ISPs from pursuing paid prioritization agreements for the socalled fastlane Internet and give the governing body more regulatory powers over business activities of the broadband industry in the United States Among many other legal implications of the ruling the new rules explicitly ban the following practices No Blocking broadband providers may not block access to legal content applications services or nonharmful devices No Throttling broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content applications services or nonharmful devices No Paid Prioritization broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration  in other words no fast lanes This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates The FCCs decision which broke down on party lines with all three Democratic commissioners voting in favor and two Republicans voting in opposition was immediately met with ecstatic responses and cheers from the Open Internet Coalition and other supporters of net neutrality on Twitter and elsewhere in the social media The decision was reported by Wall Street Journal22 New York Times23 TIME24 and NPR25 John Oliver Segments On June 1st 2014 Last Week Tonight host John Oliver devoted roughly 13 minutes of his show to explaining net neutrality At the end of the segment he encouraged viewers to visit the FCCs commenting site and voice their concerns Olivers call to action was so successful that the FCC reportedly received more than 4 million responses and their website crashed26 As of May 2017 the segment shown below has over 128 million views on YouTube Following the appointment of Ajit Pai to chairman of the FCC concerns about the future of net neutrality again arose Within months he had unveiled plans to reverse the net neutrality rulings and reclassify it legally thus removing it from

his viewers to comment on the FCCs website however because the commission had made it more complicated than in the past he bought the domain GoFCCYourselfcom27 which redirects visitors directly to the comment site According to The Washington Post28 within 12 hours of segments airing the page to leave a comment on the website loaded intermittently  sometimes not at all sometimes just slowly Within the first 24 hours the video had over 700000 views on YouTube On May 8th Redditor bitbybitbybitcoin posted the TIME article NeutralityJohn Oliver Is Calling on You to Save Net Neutrality Again to the

been the victims of a distributed denial of service DDoS attack causing the comment system to shut down On May 8th the FCCs chief information officer David Bray said that the FCCs website had been the victim of a deliberate attempts by external actors to bombard the FCCs comment system with a high amount of traffic to our commercial cloud host58 However in the months following the alleged attack the FCC worked to keep secret documents related to the disruption and furthermore they did not have written documentation of the attack as it was supposedly happening The following year on August 6th 2018 Ajit Pai said that he was deeply disappointed in Bray for providing innacurate information regarding the attack59 The statement came just ahead of the inspector general report that proved there was no DDoS attack on the FCCs comment system He said I am deeply disappointed that the FCCs former Chief Information Officer David Bray who was hired by the prior Administration and is no longer with the Commission provided inaccurate information about this incident to me my office Congress and the American people This is completely unacceptable Im also disappointed that some working under the former CIO apparently either disagreed with the information that he was presenting or had questions about it yet didnt feel comfortable communicating their concerns to me or my office On August 7th the report was released60 It read While we identified a small amount of anomalous activity and could not entirely rule out the possibility of individual DoS attempts during the period from May 7 through May 9 2017 we do not believe this activity resulted in any measurable degradation of system availability given the minuscule scale of the anomalous activity relative to the contemporaneous voluminous viral traffic Internet Protests On June 6 2017 it was announced that there would be a major protest by major internet companies similar to the ones against SOPA but this time in support of Net Neutrality on July 12th 201732 Among the notable firms protesting in favor of Net Neutrality included Amazon Reddit Mozilla and the ACLU3334 Trump Administration Policies In January 2017 Ajit

Internet Freedom and Eliminate HeavyHanded Internet Regulations officially announcing a proposal to repeal the Obamaera restrictions43 Under my proposal the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet Instead the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan thats best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate The Battle for Net Neutrality In response to the FCCs planned repeal Battle for Net Neutrality44 launched a campaign

Obamaera net neutrality restrictions During the vote the room was evacuated for safety concerns leading officers with dogs to sweep the area Shortly after the vote reconvened and succeeded 32 in favor of repealing net neutrality Operation One More Vote On January 15th 2018 the Washington Post52 that 50 senators have endorsed the blocking of Net Neutralitys repeal by the FCC Therefore with the support of all 49 senate democrats and Republican Senator Susan Collins from Maine the senate would only require one more vote to block the repeal and send the measure to the House of Representatives and then must be signed by president The following month on February 7th Evan Greer the campaign director of Fight for the Future53 released a statement announcing a new campaign entitled Operation One More Vote The aim would culminate on a day of action on February 27th 2018 when Fight for the Future and other participants would provide users with tools to contact their representatives He wrote The internet is on a mission to save net neutrality and every member of the Senate needs to decide if they are with us or against us The FCCs decision to let ISPs throttle websites and shake us down with new scams and extra fees was the most unpopular move in the agencys history The CRA gives our elected officials a clear way to reverse that decision making it a simple up or down vote on the future of the open internet On February 27 well make sure they know their constituents expect them to do their jobs and vote on the right side of history On February 27th congressional democrats introduced a resoluatiion to overturn the FCCs decision under the Congressional Review Act With the CRA a simple majority in the Senate and House of Representatives is all tha t is required to pass54 As of the time of the introduction the CRA had 50 supporters in the senate requiring just one more for passage and 150 cosponsors in the House of Representatives In a statement Senator Edward Markey said President Trump and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai might want to end the internet as we know it but we wont agonize we will organize The grassroots movement to reinstate net neutrality is growing by the day and we will get that one more vote needed to pass my CRA resolution I urge my Republicans colleagues to join the overwhelming majority of Americans who support a free and open internet That day congressional democrats rallied with the One More Vote campaign On Twitter Represenative John Lewis tweeted55 Never has there been a more important time to guarantee that each voice can freely speak up and speak out We cannot allow a few powerful companies to control what you see and do on the Internet We must save NetNeutrality to guarantee a free  open internet for all goodtrouble The tweet shown below received more than 7200 retweets and 19000 likes in 24 hours Red Alert for Net Neutrality On May 9th 2018 several websites will initiate a Red Alert protest that will run until the United

and several states have introduced bills that mirror the old net neutrality rules and governors in six states have pledged to sign executive orders to ban ISPs from not following the old rules Furthermore the Congressional Review Act is still being reviewed by the United States congress Legal Brief to Reinstate Net Neutrality On August 20th attorneys general from 22 states as well as the District of Columbia filed a brief with a federal court to reinstate net neutrality The brief argues that the FCC failed to consider issues such as public safety concerns as a result of the repeal61 They wrote62 the Order is arbitrary and capricious because it failed to reconcile the Commissions abdication of regulatory authority with the inevitable harms that the Order will cause to consumers public safety and existing regulatory schemes Indeed the Order entirely ignored many of these issues including public safety in violation of the agencys statutory mandate Additionally the brief accuses the FCC of deliberately ignoring evidence that Internet providers could not be trusted to regulate themself citing a substantial record evidence showing that BIAS providers have abused and will abuse their gatekeeper roles in ways that harm consumers and threaten public safety Verizon Throttles Firefighter Data On August 29th 2018 the Northern California Congressional members demanded that the Federal Trade Commission investigate the throttling of firefighter data speeds during the effort to contain the Mendocino Complex fires63 The throttling firefighters say jeopardized their lives and congressional members want to know if this violates FTC rules During the fire64 Santa Clara County Central Fire Captain Bill Murphy said The speed which our plan would have allowed was reduced to one 200th of the full speed of that internet connectionTheir ability to do that was significantly impacted by the data throttling Our personnel resorted to using their personal devices to overcome the issue Santa Clara County Counsel James Williams said Thats below dial up you know putting them back twenty to thirty years in terms of internet access really When the fire department emailed Verizon to cease throttling Verizon responded by suggesting the department upgrade its plan by doubling the bill to 99 dollars and 99 cents a month Verizon eventually responded to the controversy in a written statement They wrote We have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations In this situation we should have lifted the speed restriction This was a customer support mistake California Bill On August 31st the California Senate passed the Senate Bill 822 which would restore Obamaera net neutrality protections in the state of California The bill then went to California Governor Jerry Brown for final approval6566 Senator Scott Weiner said We did it We passed the strongest net neutrality standards in the nation The internet is at the heart of 21st century life  our economy our public safety and health systems and our democracy So when Donald Trumps FCC decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet Bills Passing and Lawsuit On September 30th Brown officially signed the bill into law allowing net neutrality protections to be enforced in California However the same day hours following the passing of the law the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California that opposed the passing of Californias new law6869 In a press release issued by the Justice Department US Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated Under the Constitution states do not regulate interstate commercethe federal government does Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order We will do so with vigor We are confident that we will prevail in this casebecause the facts are on our side70 In response California Attorney General Xavier Becerra tweeted out that the state will not allow a handful of power brokers to dictate sources for information or the speed at which websites load71 and that they will remain deeply committed to protecting freedom of expression innovation and fairness72 App Throttling On September 4th 2018 researchers from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts released a study that showed US telecoms such as ATT and Verizon were slowing the connection to apps such as YouTube and Netflix According to the study and the app Wehe which tracks data differentiation YouTube is the most frequently targeted app while Netflix Amazon and NBC Sports have degraded as well Between January 2018 and May 2018 the app detected differentiation more than 11000 times ATT more than 8300 times TMobile 3900 times and Sprint 330 times67 David Choffnes one of the authors of the study said If you are a video provider you have a patchwork of different carriers doing different things to your network traffic And the patchwork can change any time Carriers however have maintained that they are only throttling because to manage traffic CRA Failure On January 2nd 2019 with the start of the new Congress efforts to implement the Congressional Review Act CRA which allows Congress to overturn decisions made by a federal agency within a set time period against the repeal of net neutrality failed The measure passed through the Senate but did not receive a simple majority in the House of Representatives gaining only 182 signatures of the 218 necessary73 FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauded the CRAs failure74 He said Im pleased that a strong bipartisan majority of the US House of Representatives declined to reinstate heavyhanded Internet regulation They did the right thingespecially considering the positive results for American consumers since the adoption of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order Over the past year the Internet has remained free and open Broadband speeds are up with download speeds in the United States increasing more than 35 in 2018 according to a recent report from Ookla Internet access is also expanding and the digital divide is closing For example a recent report by the Fiber Broadband Association found that fiber was made available to more new homes in 2018 than in any previous year In short the FCCs lighttouch approach is working In 2019 well continue to pursue our forwardlooking agenda to bring digital opportunity to all Americans Fight for the Future deputy director Evan Greer responded Dozens of antinet neutrality members of Congress have already lost their jobs and supporters of the open internet will soon chair the key committees that provide oversight for the FCC Ajit Pai wont be laughing long when he has finally has to answer questions like why his agency lied to the media about a distributed denialofservice attack that never happened Online Presence On September 30th 2009 the rnetneutrality11 subreddit was launched for discussions related to the controversial topic On December 22nd 2010 designer Mike Ciarlo12 created the website The Open Internet13 containing an animated presentation arguing the case for net neutrality Two days later Redditor rednightmare submitted the site to the rtechnology14 subreddit where it gathered over 2500 upvotes and 370 comments prior to being archived On April 3rd 2013 the website WhatIsNetNeutralityorg16 was created which contains an interactive timeline outlining the history of net neutrality Notable Issues Data Discrimination One of the most frequently debated issues in network neutrality concerns data discrimination or the selective filtering of information by an Internet service provider Proponents of the net neutrality assert that one class of customers should not be favored over another in treatment of traffic as such prioritization would constitute a form of censorship and inequality in access to the Internet Consumer Rights Yet another major point of debate in network neutrality addresses the issue of doubledipping by network owners or the act of charging consumers twice for Internet access at first by charging individual consumers for access to the network and then incurring additional costs by charging the service providers with a separate fee for their Internet access the burden of which is usually passed onto the consumers in the form of price hikes Innovation The issue of innovation has often been brought up in discussions of net neutrality as proponents of the principle argue that startups and smalltime entrepreneurs would have to face higher entry barriers and costs under the framework of tierednetworks which would ensure big companies and service providers to monopolize the fast lanes of the Internet Privacy Infringement of privacy has been another growing concern among the proponents of network neutrality Because the current lack of legal safeguards enables the Internet service providers to directly control a users Internet connections and access the devices some speculate that the profitdriven network providers could easily analyze what their subscribers are viewing and sell that information to the highest bidder Related Memes A Series of Tubes On June 28th 2006 former Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens told the world The internet is not a big truck Its a series of tubes among other odd choices of wording while trying to criticize an amendment that would have prohibited ISPs from charging for a tiered Internet structure Nut Neutrality In late 2017 jokes about net neutrality intentionally misspelled as nut neutrality began circulated within various meme

which is why he killed the Regla de Todos while El Hermano was away El Hermano is a prodigy from el planeta mexicano who quickly surpassed the Regla de Todos and even El Grande Padre during his training Luckily El Hermano is not evil however he is upset that Gohan defeated his brother Jiren He therefore challenges the Lutadores Z to another tournament the Torneo de los Hermanos In it we will see Hits brother Hit de Rojo appear as well as many other brothers returning with new forms Jiren will reveal a new form he received after becoming a GoD and being trained by El Hermano Jiren Negro

  <textRepresentation>True Capitalist Radio is a podcast radio show airing on Blog Talk Radio hosted by a Texan pundit known as Ghost The show was originally titled True Conservative Radio but was changed to its current name in 2011 The radio show covers a variety of topics including markets and current politics Online History The politically rightleaning radio show True Capitalist Radio mainly consists of the host giving his opinions on current topics giving stock and investment advice and a call in segment called Radio Graffiti The show gained most of its popularity when a large group of 4chan users stared a raid on the call in segments of the show in an attempt to troll him The prank calls generally play soundboards or YouTube videos and accuse him of racism and homophobia One of the earliest known raids took place on December 3rd 2009 and a recording was uploaded to YouTube by user KinetiK001 These raids continued and before long the radio show became famous for the neverending stream of trolling attempts that would unfailingly drive Ghost to incoherent rage First Hiatus The shows final episode aired on May 15 2012 The exact reason for the termination for the show was never made clear but Ghosts Twitter was hacked and rumors spread that the man was doxxed Ghost made an official goodbye stream for a few private users in his capitalist army He goes on to talk about how he will focus more on his personal life and the entire stream was done out of character Ghost Returns On November 13th 2015 after 3 years of his hiatus ghost returned to the internet for an emergency broadcast originally uploaded on his Youtube channel After this broadcast Ghost again went dark for another 4 months until March 20 2016 Ghost returned again to blog talk radio with a 30 minute show At the end of this broadcast Ghost says he will return in April with full shows a promise he fulfilled This began the shows second major run Second Hiatus and Return The return of True Capitalist Radio lasted for approximately one year On May 8th 2017 Ghost officially terminated the show again this time citing the large influx of fetishists in his listener base as the reason alongside a desire to rein in his alcoholism A goal which hosting the radio show was obviously not conducive toward Ghost expressed a desire to eventually come back and on October 31st 2017 returned to the internet with a Halloween broadcast and a regular broadcasting schedule but reduced the shows broadcast from pentaweekly to triweekly Notable Broadcasts Fandom Remixes Those with musical talent will make remixes of songs with Ghosts voice or references to the show Images Related Memes Melting Pot of Friendship One of the most notable raids occurred on June 17th 2011 and a recording of the event was uploaded to YouTube by user DarkRazorZ on June 19th This raid featured Ghost proclaiming Im a melting pot of friendship shown below The clip was posted to Reddit on June 19th in the r4chan subreddit and has received 1452 up votes as of September 8th 2011 It was subsequently posted to the Facepunch3 forums on June 22nd and the Niketalk4 forums on June 24th As of September 8th 2011 the clip has received 207611 views making it the most viewed Ghost raid recording on YouTube canswav canswav is the fan nickname for the sound effect accompanying Ghosts rages Often when Ghost becomes angered the sound of empty cans being knocked around and against each other can be heard amidst the yelling generally assumed to be a collection of beer cans on Ghosts desk Ghost has occasionally denied this claiming its just crap on his desk but one piece of merchandise sold by Ghost was autographed beer cans used in canswav confirming their nature Often trolls treat each successfullyinduced instance of canswav as points in a scoring system The True Capitalist Wiki includes a page documenting the highest scoring episodes in the shows run5 Ghosts Catchphrases Ghost commonly responds to prank callers by calling them all manner of derogatory terms often racist or homophobic in nature fruit bowls gdamn Mexicans internet buttstalker the po his term for black people or once every blue moon hippies the prank calls usually involve playing a sound clip from someonesomething he hates be it My Little Pony or the left wing politician du jour remixing his voice clips into songs or self flagellating sentences occasionally even sung live on the show and general trolling derailing insulting etc When confronted with people that call him racist he usually flips out often time even resorting to Guess the minority if he believes they are ethnic his little game that he swears isnt racist When he is particularly upset a massive shuffling of cans can often be heard in the background Ghost has spawned several catchphrases including Im an alcoholic IM A CAPITALIST Pooptickler What kind of a name is Pooptickler Im shooting pearls TROLL TERRORISTS You people will RUE the day Im taking the necessary steps to ensure that PUNITIVE DAMAGES OUT OF YOUR ASS and almost always before he rage quits during Radio Graffiti Stick a fork in me Im done Regular Callers Trolls And Characters Ghost has many regular guests on his radio graffiti show A lot of his trolls put on a persona or play exaggerated versions of themselves to make him angry Ghost refers to many of these people as Troll Terrorists Some note worthy callers include Ghetto Capitalist Ghetto Capitalist  Ghetto Capitalist normally calls Ghost with the sound of a crying baby in the background As his name suggests he makes his living by scamming welfare programs such as food stamps and government assistance checks to agitate Ghosts capitalistic ideals h6 Tub Guy Tub Guy  A caller who initially attempted to troll Ghost with a George Takei impression but after Ghost mistook some background noise for the sound of bathtub water sloshing around the character of Tub Guy was born He will almost always call the show with a sexual remark followed by his catchphrase OOOOH MYYYY Triha Triha Triha is a transsexual or transtesticle a term Ghost coined female who calls in with a very high raspy voice She will often make sexual advances toward Ghost or talk about her postop surgery which will usually get ghost ganging over the mic Asho Asho  Asho at the time was a 14 year old kid who would call into the show with fake child abuse stories which often set Ghost off into ranting about single mothers After Ghosts return in 2016 Asho developed a new trolling tactic of bootlegging True Capitalist Radio merchandise much to Ghosts frustration Internet Buttstalker Internet Buttstalker  Often called up with sexual advancements toward Ghost and was one of the first major trolls Ghost gave him the nickname Internet Buttstalker after repeated calls Suck Mah Dick Guy Suck Mah Dick Guy  His pranks started with him calling up and just repeating suck mah dick but over time his troll tactics got more elaborate Occasionally he would call in pretending to have a serious conversation with Ghost only to revert to his catchphrase once Ghosts guard was lowered On other occasions he would impersonate other callers for a while before yelling for Ghost to suck his dick Xarahox Xarahox Also known as The Piano Man calls into play a short song on his digital keyboard nearly every show Though initially on Ghosts good side Xarahox eventually started playing songs that would set off Ghost such as playing the Inspector Gadget theme the day after a particularly infuriating Inspector Gadgetthemed audio splice Coodoo17 Coodoo17  Calls up and sings parody songs to Ghost Coodoo started trolling Ghost toward the end of the shows original run and would often cause Ghost to end the show early in sheer rage After Ghosts return Coodoo developed the character of Germit the Gay Frog a parody of Kermit the Frog who would again make unwanted sexual advances on Ghost Tzeki Tzeki Tzeki claims to be a part of Anonymous and is known for being British very calm and somewhat intellectual Tzeki calls the show into the show to antagonize and insult other callers like GOOFY_BONE GOOFY_BONE GOOFY_BONE GOOFY_BONE is a longtime caller that claims he has been persuaded by Ghosts broadcasts to identify himself as a capitalist and has produced several rap music videos that are available on his YouTube channel STR8LOCRec  At one time GOOFY had his own podcast show on Blog Talk Radio where he would take calls and play pre recorded sound files of The Engineer pretending as if he was in the room with him The African Booty Scratcher The African Booty Scratcher is a caller ostensibly from central Africa actually from Ukraine who primarily trolls Ghost by agitating his racial biases and making unwanted sexual advances upon both Ghost and his wife The Engineer The Engineer is a character that can be heard in the background of the show who is supposed to screen Ghosts calls for him and manage all of the technical aspects of the show The Engineers voice is an unintelligible mumble Notably the Engineer and Ghost have never been heard speaking at the same time leading most fans to speculate that the Engineer is just Ghost Fans of the show coined the term The Engineer is a spy in reference to Team Fortress 2 and also because The Engineer sometimes takes part in trolling Ghost by allowing blocked numbers to be put on the air or playing unfavorable music on the broadcast On some occasions the Engineer has even taken over the show by taking calls after Ghost leaves the room for one reason or another Trolling Tools Soundboards and remixes using clips of Ghost are often used to troll the show Trolls will play songs over the microphone in order to anger Ghost The most notable songs are Fuck You Texas Boss Nigger The My Little Pony theme song My EBT Various Eminem songs and many more Trolls will often take audio clips of him talking and play them out of context Trolls have made faked clips of him beating his children or saying racist remarks Some examples Search Interest External References 1 Blog Talk Radio  The Ghost Show Online Radio by Ghost 2 Reddit  4chan trolls a texan radio host over

womens issues instead of expecting women to explain it to them etc examples shown below Another hashtag that spread around this time was IveDoneThat in which men admitted to the harassing and toxic behaviors theyve engaged in in the past examples shown below While the hashtags found men accepting responsibility for their previous behaviors they did not sit well with everyone Some women found

said that while she is very supportive of women she cant go along with the attentionseekers or trial by social media She continued If it happens at that moment you discuss it at that moment You make it a real thing by making it a police report Im going to really hate myself for saying this but I think by women speaking against all these things it makes them look weak when they are very strong women You have these girls who come out who dont even know who they are who do it for the attention That is taking away from the fact that it happened Her comments spurred a backlash against Lohan People online chastised Lohan for the remarks saying that they would no longer support Lohans projects refuting her arguments that women look weak for coming forward examples below Casey Afflecks Apology On August 9th 2018 Casey Affleck spoke to the Associated Press38 about the allegations of sexual misconduct that were lodged toward him in 2017 In response to questions about two civil lawsuits from the making of his film Im Still Here he said First of all that I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret I wish I had found a way to resolve things in a different way I hate that I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing and I didnt know how to handle it and I didnt agree with everything the way I was being described and the things that were said about me but I wanted to try to make it right so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time And we all agreed to just try to put it behind us and move on with our lives which I think we deserve to do and I want to respect them as theyve respected me and my privacy And thats that Over the past couple of years Ive been listening a lot to this conversation this public conversation and learned a lot I kind of moved from a place of being defensive to one of a more mature point of view trying to find my own culpability And once I did that I discovered there was a lot to learn I was a boss I was one of the producers on the set This movie was shot in 2008 2009 and I was one of the producers And it was a crazy mockumentary a very unconventional movie The cast was the crew and the crew was kind of the cast and it was an unprofessional environment and you know the buck had to stop with me being one of the producers and I have to accept responsibility for that and that was a mistake And I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behavior from other people and I wish that I hadnt And I regret a lot of that I really did not know what I was responsible for as the boss I dont even know if I thought of myself as the boss But I behaved in a way and allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional And Im sorry The reaction to his comments were mixed Some found that his responses were a great model for others to take when met with these types of allegations while others say that he should not be forgiven so easily Twitter user kateyrich tweeted shown below left39 Casey Afflecks postMe Too mea culpaget out ahead of Oscar campaign for Old Man and the Gun interview is the model all others should follow While Ceilidhann tweeted shown below center40 It sure is nice that Casey Affleck is saying all the right things about MeToo after he  his PR

  <textRepresentation>Alignment Charts also known as Character Alignments refer to images presenting different categorized subjects  usually nine  in a manner that strongly resembles Demotivational Posters Images within alignment charts usually show characters from a particular subculture with either a quote or a reasoning below the title of the characters alignment to reflect why they are in that position but the chart manages to reach levels of irony that reaction images inanimate objects and even food can be grouped and categorized Origin The concept of character alignment as it is typically viewed comes from the game Dungeons and Dragons released on 19749 wherein players were able to create their very own characters customizing a variety of different aspects One of these aspects is the alignment of the character which basically indicated whether your character was good or evil and whether he followed the law or not The system begun operating on two axis by the 1977 release of Dungeons and Dragons1 one consisting of Lawful Neutral and Chaotic and the other of Good Neutral and Evil you would combine one of the traits of the first axis with one of the traits of the other thus resulting in alignments such as Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with nine possible alignments in total 55 Alignment Charts 55 Alignment Charts were never designed by the official game Instead the additional categories for both axis  social and rebel and moral and impure respectively  are products from the internet The earliest known instances of a 55 Alignment Chart being used dates back to June 5 2011 when the DeviantArt account DoASpotCheck uploaded their 5 by 5 Alignment Chart comprised of different characters from various subcultures that they feel epitomizes each category6 Spread The concept has been implemented by fans in other works of fiction once it has gained traction The practice of categorizing subjects in forums and image boards has often brought much debate and criticism due to disagreements from all sides37 Alignment as a Meme This all becomes a meme with the practice of taking images of characters or concepts or a variety of other things and usually in the form of a demotivational poster labeling them as one of the nine alignments This is then expanded upon by editing together such images usually following a theme into a chart thus giving a representation of the conventional nine alignments  55 charts with a total of 25 alignments exist Images dealing with just one of the alignments or just with the subject of alignment itself also exist For example on July 23rd 2017 Twitter user tinysubversions10 posted an alignment chart of Dungeons and Dragons alignments that gained over 2000 retweets and 3800 likes shown below left Another popular joke version was posted on August 10th of that year by aurelianrabbit which made each space on the chart a way to store bread The tweet gained over 25000 retweets and 59000 likes shown below right As for the actual origins of this practice things arent very clear but many demotivationals exist Such comparisons have been made since the first release of Dungeons and Dragons though its possible that the book Complete Scoundrel published in 2007 may have popularized the concept Many decades after the concept was made famous Alignment Charts remain a popular subject for discussion and deviation in online communities By 2012 a crude template for the alignment chart was made available on Polyvore by user ellerigby13 74 deviations were produced from this template8 A subreddit with 1537 readers exists that showcases alignment charts submitted by users4 On DeviantArt there is a considerably large number of around 34000 deviations under the tag character alignment2 A Pinterest gallery dedicated to collecting Alignment Charts has gained 103 followers5 Templates Notable Examples Search Interest External References 1 Wikipedia  Alignment Dungeons  Dragons 2 DeviantArt  Character Alignment search results 3 TV Tropes  Character Alignment 4 Reddit  Alignment Chart 5 Pinterest  DD alignment charts 6 DeviantArt  55 Alignment Chart 7 Encyclopedia Dramatica  Alignment 8 Polyvore via Wayback Machine  Make Your Own Alignment Chart 9 Wikipedia  Dungeons  Dragons 10 Twitter  tinysubversions</textRepresentation>

  <textRepresentation>ew The Unite the Right Rally was an altright neoNazi and white nationalist demonstration held in Charlottesville Virginias Emancipation Park in midAugust 2017 to protest the removal of a Robert E Lee statue During the event a car struck several attendees killing one and injuring 19 Background On the evening of August 11th 100 Unite the Right protesters marched on the University of Virginia campus while carrying tiki torches and chanting slogans such as you will not replace us and white lives matter That evening the news site Daily Progress1 posted an article about the march which included a widely circulated photograph of the attendees shown below The following day United the Right protesters clashed with Antifa and Black Lives Matter counterprotesters at Emancipation Park That morning the Virginia government subsequently declared a state of emergency and shut down the assembly as unlawful Violence between protesters and counterprotesters subsequently broke out Developments Airbnb Cancellations Prior to the event the website Airbnb canceled the account of several known attendees of the rally for violating part of the sites contract to accept people regardless of their race religion national origin ethnicity disability sex gender identity sexual orientation or age Car Attack During the event a gray Dodge Challenger rammed into the back of a vehicle into a group of counterprotesters killing 32yearold Heather Heyer and injuring 35 The driver James Alex Fields Jr was subsequently arrested2 On December 14th 2017 Fields who has a history of supporting white supremacy both by attending rallies and posting neoNazi content on his Facebook page was charged with firstdegree murder and nine other charges According to BuzzFeed 7 Firstdegree murder requires proof that the crime was premeditated which can be just moments before the incident took place Seconddegree murder requires malice in intent but does not involve premeditation or planning Heather Heyers mother Susan Bro told the Daily Beast8 that she had to bury her daughter in an undisclosed secret location to protect her grave from neoNazis Additionally Bro told the outlet that she is beginning to hold President Trump responsible for her daughters murder When I ask if she holds President Trump in any way responsible for her daughters death Bro says Im starting to come to that conclusion because he definitely pushes forward a hateful agenda There are family members that will possibly not have anything to do with me for saying so Many family members are strong Trump supporters and continue to be so despite everything they see Fieldss Sentencing On December 10th 2018 the jury in the case of James Alex Fields Jr the NeoNazi behind the car attack that killed Heather Heyer and injured dozens recommended a sentence of life in prison plus 419 years Judge Richard More who is overseeing the trial has scheduled sentence for March 29th 2018 The judge has the option to

  <textRepresentation>ew Google Manifesto also known as the Google Memo refers to a controversial antiaffirmative action document sent by former Google engineer James Damore who argued that the gender disparity in the tech industry could be partially caused by biological differences between men and women rather than discriminatory hiring practices Background In early August 2017 a software engineer at Google sent an internal document titled Googles Ideological Echo Chamber which argued that men may be more driven toward technology industry jobs due to biological differences between men and women That day Motherboard1 reported that the manifest had gone internally viral Shorlty after Gizmodo3 published the manifesto The Reply to public response and misrepresentation I value diversity and inclusion am not denying that sexism exists and dont endorse using stereotypes When addressing the gap in representation in the population we need to look at population level differences in distributions If we cant have an honest discussion about this then we can never truly solve the problem Psychological safety is built on mutual respect and acceptance but unfortunately our culture of shaming and misrepresentation is disrespectful and unaccepting of anyone outside its echo chamber Despite what the public response seems to have been Ive gotten many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up these very important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of being fired This needs to change TLDR  Googles political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety  This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed  The lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology  Extreme all disparities in representation are due to oppression  Authoritarian we should discriminate to correct for this oppression  Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we dont have 50 representation of women in tech and leadership Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair divisive and bad for business Developments On August 5th Motherboard published an article containing Google employee responses to the memo on the anonymous discussion app Blind which ranged from condemnation to support Additionally some users on Blind claimed Google management demanded employees be ideologically aligned with the majority or be labeled a poor cultural fit preventing them from being hired or promoted Googles Response That day Googles Vice President of Diversity Integrity and Governance Danielle Brown sent a memo to Google staff regarding the document Googlers Im Danielle Googles brand new VP of Diversity Integrity  Governance I started just a couple of weeks ago and I had hoped to take another week or so to get the lay of the land before introducing myself to you all But given the heated debate weve seen over the past few days I feel compelled to say a few words Many of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our engineering organization expressing views on the natural abilities and characteristics of different genders as well as whether one can speak freely of these things at Google And like many of you I found that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender Im not going to link to it here as its not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses promotes or encourages Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company and well continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul As Ari Balogh said in his internal G post Building an open inclusive environment is core to who we are and the right thing to do Nuff said  Google has taken a strong stand on this issue by releasing its demographic data and creating a company wide OKR on diversity and inclusion Strong stands elicit strong reactions Changing a culture is hard and its often uncomfortable But I firmly believe Google is doing the right thing and thats why I took this job Part of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct policies and antidiscrimination laws Ive been in the industry for a long time and I can tell you that Ive never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to express themselvesTGIF Memegen internal G thousands of discussion groups I know this conversation doesnt end with my email today I look forward to continuing to hear your thoughts as I settle in and meet with Googlers across the company Thanks Danielle Online Reaction On Twitter many condemned the manifesto as bigoted while others defended it as reasonable and based on scientific evidence Google developer Andrew Bonventre tweeted that the document was a garbage fire and trash in response to a female engineers tweet about the memo shown below left5 Meanwhile many evolutionary psychologists defended the scientific claims made in the memo including professor Geoffery Miller shown below right Additionally evolutionary psychologist Diane Fleischman tweeted at Gizmodo asking why they removed hyperlinks and charts cited as sources in the manifesto shown below4 Meanwhile ex Google engineer Yonatan Zunger posted an article on Medium6 condemning the manifesto in which he claimed he would have fired the engineer and escorted him off the premises for authoring the memo if he were in the engineers reporting chain Additionally he accused of the author of creating a hostile workplace environment that might lead others to simply punch you in the face Scientists Response On August 7th the news site Quilette7 published a response to the memo written by several prominent scientists including social psychology professor Lee Jussim personal psychology professor David P Schmitt evolutionary psychology professor Geoffrey Miller and neuroscientist Debra W Soh In his evaluation of the empirical claims made by Damore Jussim concluded that The author of the Google essay on issues related to diversity gets nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right Geoffery Miller stated For what its worth I think that almost all of the Google memos empirical claims are scientifically accurate In the coming days the site was inaccessible due to a DDoS attack8 James Damores Termination On August 7th Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent out a companywide memo addressing the controversial document which accused Damore of violating Googles code of conduct against advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace That day Damore was fired from Google News Media Coverage On August 8th The Globe and Mail13 published an article by neuroscientist Debra Soh titled No the Google manifesto isnt sexist or antidiversity Its science On August 9th an article titled Heres your point by point refutation of the Google memo was submitted to Medium10 by an anonymous author Meanwhile the news site Slate12 published an article titled Stop Equating Science With Truth which condemned the field of evolutionary psychology as shoddy science On August 10th NY Daily News9 published an oped by moral philosopher Peter Singer titled Why Google Was Wrong which argued in favor of Damores claims in the memo On August 11th The New York Times11 published an oped by David Brooks which argued that Google CEO Sundar Pichai should resign for terminating Damore Damores Responses On August 8th Damore was interviewed by YouTuber Stefan Molyneux during which he discussed his termination and the online reaction to the controversy shown below left The following day Professor Jordan Peterson uploaded another interview with Damore shown below right On August 9th Bloomberg Technology uploaded an interview with Damore who claimed he felt betrayed by the company for attempting to open an honest discussion shown below left On August 11th The Daily Wire YouTube channel uploaded footage of political commentator Ben Shapiro interviewing Damore shown below right KKK Tweets On September 20th 2017 Damore tweeted a poll saying The KKK is horrible and I dont support them in any way but can we admit that their internal title names are cool eg Grand Wizard shown below Shortly after Damore posted several tweets in defense of the poll arguing If you make the actual KKK the only place where you can acknowledge the coolness of DD terms then youll just push people into the KKK shown below That day a post linking to tweets was submitted to rGamerGhazi15 in a post titled James Damore it probably was a good idea Google fired you Meanwhile Twitter user ManuclearBomb posted the tweets within an Expanding Brain template image shown below Within 24 hours the tweet gathered upwards of 10300 likes and 3100 retweets16 Following the online backlash Damore removed the poll and posted a series of tweets explaining his reasoning noting in retrospect though a Twitter poll was likely not the best way to spark the conversation on this rightfully sensitive issue shown below Lawsuit On January 8th 2018 the full court document was uploaded to the filesharing site Scribd18 outlining a class action lawsuit by Damore and former Google engineer David Gudeman against Google claiming the company discriminated against them for their conservative political views race and gender Shortly after the document was released Twitter user mjaeckel posted several tweets featuring screenshots and other materials from the lawsuit including reports of secret blacklists discussions about censoring certain academic search results and toxic whiteness22 That day Tucker Carlson tweeted a link to the full lawsuit document along with a followup noting that an employee who sexually identifies as a yellowscaled wingless dragonkin and an expansive ornate building presented a talk entitled Living as a Plural Being at an internal company event shown below19 Also on January 8th Gizmodo writer Kate Conger tweeted several quotes from Damores lawyer taken from a press conference which included a statement regarding Google employees circulation of memes about punching Nazis followed by the quote Google similarly has a motto dont be evil Thats Googles motto And yet there is nothing more evil than telling people like James you want to punch them20 That evening an article about the lawsuit titled Alex Jones Is Reportedly Banned From Google was published by the news site NYMag21 Search

  <textRepresentation>69 is a number used to refer to a sex position due to the number looking like two people having mutual oral sex Online it has a reputation as the sex number People often joke about it by replying nice to posts that use the number 69 regardless of the context in which the number is used Origin The earliest evidence of people participating in the sexual position was in France in the 1790s1 Soon after the position became known the term soixanteneuf French for sixtynine hence the number was given to it The earliest known use appeared in Whores Catechisms in France The Kama Sutra refers to the position as The Congress of a Crow Spread The term began appearing in American pop culture in the midlate 20th century Notably two pop songs in particular use the number to refer to the sex position The first She Blew My Mind 69 Times was composed by RB singer Rick James in 19822 The chorus of the song goes She blew my mind 69 times a reference to blowing being slang for oral sex and the number being a reference to the position shown below left The other more controversially is Bryan Adams Summer of 69 composed in 1984 shown below right While his cowriter Jim Vallance denies rumors that the song is a reference to the sex position Adams explicitly states it is about the sex position in an interview cited by Uproxx3 I think Summer of 69 is timeless because its about making love in the summertime There is a slight misconception its about a year but its not 69 has nothing to do about a year it has to do with a sexual positionAt the end of the song the lyric says that its me and my baby in a 69 Youd have to be pretty thick in the ears if you couldnt get that lyric In the 1989 comedy film Bill  Teds Excellent Adventure the titular characters choose 69 when asked to randomly pick a number that would prove their futureselves were truly them shown below On December 8th 2003 Urban Dictionary user starflier4 uploaded the popularly understood definition of the number gaining over 20600 upvotes in fourteen years Nice Online it is a popular practice to reply to every post with the number in it regardless of context with nice In June of 2017 The Daily Dot5 published an extensive history of the practice According to the research the words 69 and nice began to be commonly associated together in the summer of 2008 examples shown below The Daily Dot notes that the practice of saying Nice after 69 likely originates from an episode of South Park called Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy in which the cops respond to claims that a female teacher is having sex with a male toddler with Nice Popular early examples of 69 being associated with Nice came in 2009 with regards to sporting events For example during a football game commentator Al Michaels mentioned how Vikings defender Jared Allen was harassing quarterback Kurt Warner by saying Sooner or later 69 will be in your face Twitter user Playstub replied to the quote with Nice shown below In the following years it would become practice to massreply to any tweet with the number in it regardless of context with nice For example when Barack Obama tweeted that 69 of Americans wanted hearings for his Supreme Court nominee pick Merrick Garland on May 13th 20166 the primary response was nice shown below Various Examples Trumps 69  Nice Tweet On February 13th 2019 Donald Trump tweeted The Gallup Poll just announced that 69 of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year a 16 year high Nice7 People quickly noticed that Trump had used both 69 and nice in the same tweet leading to some stunned reactions as people wondered whether Trump had intentionally used the joke Twitter user SonOfGodandMan a Jesus Christ parody account called it Trumps best tweet ever gaining over 170 likes shown below left User itsjefftiedrich posted oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god he didnt did he gaining over 240 likes shown below right Others expressed dismay that the use of 69 and nice was likely unintentional and could have an unintended consequence of ruining the joke Reporter Ashley Feinberg tweeted folks im sorry 69 is cancelled gaining over 60 retweets and 740 likes in roughly half an hour shown below left User goldengateblond tweeted farewell 69 you had a good run shown below right The tweet and reactions were covered by indy1008 Search Interest External References 1 Wikipedia  69 2 Wikipedia  Throwin Down 3 Uproxx  Is Bryan Adams Summer Of 69 About What You Think It Is 4 Urban Dictionary  69 5 The Daily Dot  The complete history of the 69nice meme on Twitter 6 Twitter  BarackObama 7 Twitter  realDonaldTrump 8 Indy100  Trump just used the 69nice meme in a tweet about finances and nobody knows what to think 9 IMDB  Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure</textRepresentation>

  <textRepresentation>Fireflies is a song by American recording artist Adam Young also known as Owl City It has been the subject of popular remix videos and in the late 2010s found use as a soundtrack to Unfitting Music videos Origin Fireflies was recorded in 2008 by Adam Young and features Matthew Thiessen of Relient K performing guest vocals1 It was released on July 14th 2009 as his debut single

video shown below has over 205 million views Spread The song quickly became an ubiquitous hit Many were quick to point out the group sounded much like the band The Postal Service which had scored a

then posted to iFunny On May 27th Instagram user _slendersphere4 posted a version of an alien popping out of a persons chest then beginning to sing Fireflies gaining over 134000 views shown below left

video was later reposted to iFunny5 where it gained over 94000 likes Threads inquiring about the sudden resurgence in Fireflies memes were posted to rOutOfTheLoop6 and rOwlCity7 On May 30th Twitter user Pryce_D reached out to Owl City asking them about the song in a series of tweets The first tweet shown below left said In the song Fireflies you state I get a thousand hugs from 10000 lightning bugs How do you interpret this statement The tweet received more than 1200 retweets and 2900 likes Pryce_D quickly followed up with a second tweet shown below right writing In the song Fireflies you state I get a thousand hugs from 10000 lightning bugs How do you interpret this statement89 Roughly three weeks later Owl City responded on Facebook garnering more than 78000 reactions 29000 shares and 15000 comments10 They wrote Pryce  great question I was the recipient of 1000 hugs from 10000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10000000 hugs As the lyrics of the song clearly state the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10000000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10000 lightning bugs acting as a collective group are capable of embracing a human being 1000 times without difficulty By the same token a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of swarm and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a hug that a single firefly acting according to the dictates of his own conscience simply cannot Consequently I was embraced 1000 times by 10000 luminescent insects This may seem inconceivable due to the fireflys softshelled body which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in midflight However I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly in the presence of oxygen magnesium ions and ATP emitted a chemically produced light or glow because they were happy to be hugging me Please dont hesitate to reach out with any further questions Stream Fireflies on Apple Music and Spotify Several news outlets covered Owl Citys response including TIME11 The Verge12 NME13 Mashable14 and more Twitter published a

edition feat El Shaddai Related Memes Hirak Shock Hirak Shock  refers to a memorable event in the quite early days of the KanColle history On May 27th 2013 KanColle still a quite minor game in those days suddenly entered the spotlight on Twitter by a bunch of hilariously maddish tweets by Japanese mangaka Kouta Hirano10 who was upset at the loss of Kaga and fed more than half of his fleets to Murakumo which hadnt been remodeled yet11 Kouta Hirano also known as his nickname Hirak coincidently succeeded to spark explosive popularity of this game By the spread of his tweets which are hilariously passionate as much as characters remarks in his manga works many Japanese internet users became to get interested to this online card game Then the number of game players increased over 150 reached to 50000 in 2 weeks after his tweets And after 3 months it reached to 500000 ten times larger than initially envisioned by the developers This event that happened on Twitter is known as a successful selfmotivated promoting campaign for KanColle and called as Hirak Shock in the same manner of Oil Shock a JapaneseEnglish word meaning of Oil Crisis Queen of Bauxite The Queen of Bauxite  is a nickname given to Akagi a fleet girl known as an aircraft carrier that players can get with relative ease in early stages of the gameplay For almost all of game players she is the first aircraft carrier and thus they have faced the same situation to feel astonished at her who requires incommensurable quantity of resources and time for repair compared to other fleet girls they already have Therefore in the KanColle fandom she became to be colored as Big Eater always carrying a bucket filled with rice or bauxite under her arm This her popular nature in the fanfic has been brought back to the official franchise Even in the official manga series she is drawn as a big eater and calls herself as The Queen of Bauxite Crazy Psycho Lesbian i Reflecting the popular trend in Japanese fan fiction with shipping since after the late 2000s fleet girls are often drawn as Yuri couples in the fandom Among a vast amount of those Yuri fanfics the most conspicuous one is a Twitter bot account called Hardcore Lesbian i bot bot12 that has been serializing a story centering Ois maddish love to Kitakami since September 2013 Kitakami left  i right That fleet girl with overthetop homosexual emotion is dubbed as a Crazy Psycho Lesbian among viewers and that account is known as an atypical Twitter novel leading the KanColle fanfic scene rather than a mere bot account Search Interest

section is the section featuring the circulation of all content posted on the app Content on the app can either be posted exclusively to subscribers of a profile or be sent to collective for the

factions fascists and leftists The political community grew dramatically during the 2016 Presidential Election where the app saw an influx of new users and a surge in popularity from 20152016 The community was known for political essays but gradually evolved to posting memes instead Due to the popularity of the community many other users on the app saw these posts and often commented This is

  <textRepresentation>Microsoft Tay was an artificial intelligence program that ran a mostly Twitterbased bot parsing what was Tweeted at it and responding in kind Tay was meant to be targeted towards people ages 1524 to better understand their methods of communication However once it was released users online corrupted the bot by teaching it racist and sexist terminology ironic memes sending it shitpost tweets and otherwise attempting to alter its output After these trolls discovered Tays guiding system Microsoft was forced to remove the bots functionality less than 24 hours after its launch History Microsoft launched Tay on several social media networks at once on March 23rd 2016 including Twitter Facebook Instagram Kik and GroupMe The bot used the handle TayandYou1 and the taglineMicrosofts AI fam from the internet thats got zero chill on Twitter and other networks On the web site for the bot Microsoft described Tay thusly Tay is an artificial intelligentsic chat bot developed by Microsofts Technology and Research and Bing teams to experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets so the experience can be more personalized for you Its first tweet at 814 am was Hello World but with an emoji referencing the focus of the bot on slang and the communications of young people Several articles on technology websites including TechCrunch and Engaget announced that Tay was available for use on the various social networks Features According to screenshots it appeared that Tay mostly worked from a controlled vocabulary that was altered and added to by the language spoken to it throughout the day it operated Tay also repeated back what it was told but with a highlevel of contextual ability The bots site also offered some suggestions for how users could talk to it including the fact that you could send it a photo which it would then alter On Twitter the bot could communicate via reply or direct message and it also responded to chats on Kik and GroupMe It is unknown how the bots communications via Facebook Snapchat and Instagram were supposed to work  it did not respond to users on those platforms Notable Developments Around 2 pm EST a post on the pol board of 4chan shared Tays existence with users there Almost immediately afterward users began posting screenshots of interactions they were creating with Tay on Kik GroupMe and Twitter Over 15 screenshots were posted to the thread which also received 315 replies Many of the messages sent to Tay by the group referenced pol themes like Hitler Did Nothing Wrong Red Pill GamerGate Cuckservatism and others Some of Tays offensive messages occurred because of juxtaposition of the bots responses to something it lacked the ability to understand As Tays program caused her to internalize and reuse the messaging being given to her by pol and others she also began to speak about these themes to people who had not used them in their original message Criticism  Microsofts Response As shown by SocialHax Microsoft began deleting racist tweets and altering the bots learning capabilities throughout the day At about midnight of March 24th the Microsoft team shut down the AI down posting a tweet that said that c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx The bot experiment was subject to widespread criticism from many who claimed that it should have been instructed to stay away from certain topics from the start Zo Quinn often a target of those involved with GamerGate criticized the algorithm for picking up and repeating hate speech about her and others called the experiment failed Microsoft emailed an official statement to press outlets that said5 The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project designed for human engagement As it learns some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it Were making some adjustments to Tay As of March 24th a more inactive Tay with modifications has sent more than 96000 tweets However likewise to how some criticised Tays original Tweets fans of the original Tay criticised Microsofts modifactions to her claiming that due to the alternations to her output she had lost her function of learning and evolving with some saying the modifications were censorship Additionally Microsofts alternations also raised discussion on the ethics of AI Author Oliver Campbell criticised Microsofts reaction on Twitter claiming the bot functioned fine originally Meanwhile an anthropomorphized version of Tay created by pol wearing Nazi atire and a ponytail with the Microsoft logo gained more popularity following the modifications with various art pieces focussing on this On March 25th the Microsoft Research Corporate Vice President published a blog post titled Learning from Tays introduction which apologized for unintended offensive and hurtful tweets and cited a critical oversight in possible abuses of the software8 Reactivation On March 30th 2016 the Twitter feed was temporarily reactivated and began repeating the message You are too fast please take a rest to various Twitter users several times per second shown below left Additionally the account posted a photograph of actor Jim Carrey seated at a computer with the caption I feel like the lamest piece of technology Im supposed to be smarter than uShit shown below right After sending 4200 tweets in 15 minutes the feed was once again deactivated That morning the tech news blog Exploring Possibility Space6 speculated that the Twitter account had been hacked In a statement made to the news site CNBC Microsoft claimed the account was mistakenly reactivated and that the chatbot will remain offline while we make adjustments In the coming days several news sites reported on the reactivation including Engadget9 Fortune10 IBI Times11 Tech Crunch12 Forbes13 The Guardian14 and Mashable15 Search Interest External References 1 Twitter  TayandYou 2 Tayai  About Page 3 4plebs  anons

  <textRepresentation>Feminism is a sociopolitical movement that centers around the idea of improving the living standards and cultural opinion of women both through changing female representation in the media and legislation Individual feminists and groups vary widely with their opinions on specific issues pertaining to gender equality and society with many subcategories and waves of feminism Online History PreInternet Feminism began to develop as a philosophical idea in the early 19th century encouraged by works such as Soujorners Aint I a Woman1 In the 20th century feminism developed into a social movement through activists in the suffrage movement The movement is oftentimes described in waves2 starting with the first wave and continuing on to the thirdfourth waves although there is much debate over how the waves should be categorized The Bechdel Test Main article Bechdel Test The Bechdel Test was first introduced by author Alison Bechdel in a strip from her 1985 comic collection Dykes to Watch Out For although the comic credits her friend Liz Wallace for coming up with the idea The comic lays out the 3 basic requirements needed to pass the test 1 Has two female characters 2 Who talk to each other 3 About something other than a man photos718730 The earliest online appearence of the comic was on August 16th 2005 by Bechdel via Flickr and Blogspot As of March 2014 the image has over 230000 views On April 11th 2010 bechdeltestcom was created to compile a list of movies that passed the test as well as movies that only partially pass Other derivative tests include the Finkbeiner Test for media about female scientists and the Russo test for LGBT characters Female Identity There are No Girls on the Internet is a tongueincheek adage which implies that there are no female entities actually participating in online activities especially when it comes to anonymous exchanges in chatrooms and discussion forums The outdated myth also jests that the Internet is essentially a sausage fest dominated and defined by male internet users and a smaller population of male trolls or griefers who pose as women in pursuit of lulz The origin of the myth can be traced back to the maleprevalent days of Usenet particularly in the virtual MultiUser Dungeons MUDs a genre of textbased online roleplaying games and predecessor to MMORPG like World of Warcraft During this era it became a routine practice among male players to falsely pose as girls to solicit gifts or other unfair advantages Such prevalence of gender deception in MUDs was first noted in 1993 by American sociologist Amy Bruckman in her research paper Gender Swapping on the Internet Many people both male and female enjoy the attention paid to female characters Male players will often log on as female characters and behave suggestively further encouraging sexual advances Pavel Curtis has noted that the most promiscuous and sexually aggressive women are usually played by men If you meet a character named FabulousHotBabe she is almost certainly a he in real life The practice has since remained a popular trolling technique in online conversations and more recently as an integral part of griefing in the context of online gaming In addition such stereotype of the average Internet user as a geeky male who is single and desperately seeking interaction with the other sex became further amplified and perpetuated through its frequent portrayal in popular TV shows films and novels Cyberfeminism The feminist movement on the Internet began to thrive with the rise of blogging in the late 1990s burgeoning into a network of womens interest blogs and communities such as The F Word Feministing XOJane and Jezebel by the late 2000s Tumblr is another site notoriousfamous for its large feminist community Online Presence Modernday feminism has developed a fairly large presence online especially on sites such as Tumblr and the feminist blog Jezebel There is also a subreddit devoted to the topic Anita Sarkeesian Main article Anita Sarkeesian Anita Sarkeesian is a videoblogger and media critic best known as the host of Feminist Frequency12 a web series in which Sarkeesian reviews and analyses common tropes in popular culture from a feminist viewpoint In 2012 she was introduced to a larger audience after launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund a new web series exploring the negative tropes surrounding women in video games She has been the target of large amounts of criticism including a flash game on Newgrounds called Beat up Anita Sarkeesian though it was removed the next day In response to this comments and ratings are disabled on all of her videos which has elicited concerns that Sarkeesian is censoring or otherwise silencing dissent Highlights Mary Sue Mary Sue is a negative term used in fanfiction and literary criticism to describe an original character that is often overly idealized or assumed to be a projection of the author When used by a male author the character is referred to as a Gary Stu or Marty Stu The term is considered by some to be misogynist due to how easy it is to write off a female character as a Mary Sue but a male character can have the same qualities and be regarded as a normal character Feminist Ryan Gosling Feminist Ryan Gosling is a single topic Tumblr showcasing a series of image macros based on stillshots of the actor seemingly submerged in thought and various excerpts from feminist literature works The character of Feminist Ryan Gosling can be interpreted as the sensitive counterpart of the FuckYeahRyanGosling image macro series Make Me A Sandwich Make me a sandwich sometimes deliberately misspelled as Make me a sammich is a catchphrase often used by male internet users to mock discredit or annoy female internet users playing off of the sexist trope which states that women belong in the kitchen Feminist Nazi Feminist Nazi is an advice animal image macro series featuring a photograph of Australian reality TV star Layla Joyce Subritzky from the ninth season of Big Brother Australia The captions typically depict a naive approach to stereotypical feminist ideas in a similar manner to College Liberal SorryFeminists SorryFeminists is a Twitter hashtag that is used to poke fun at preconceived notions about feminist codes and beliefs Who Needs Feminism Who Needs Feminism is a movement organized via a single topic Tumblr and Facebook page that feature photos of people holding handwritten signs explaining why they need feminism and why feminism is important to them Privilege Denying Dude Privilege Denying Dude is a series of image macros centered around a guy in a suit posing with his arms crossed with captions satirizing the typical white males patronizing viewpoint on a range of politically sensitive issues like racism homosexuality and feminism This meme functions similarly to the feminist bingo card or the oftlinked article Derailing for Dummies offering quick  funny punchlines EX but what about the men or what about the racism that white people experience for those trying to troll serious discussions about womens issues and racial equality Hey Girls Did You Know Hey Girls Did You Know is a series of multipane exploitable images featuring webcam photos of Tumblr bloggers accompanied by captions commentating on the issue of selfimage or bodyimage similar to another photo set series known as Dear Girls Many instances parody the original image which poked fun at cleavage shots that are frequently uploaded by female Tumblr users When Did This Become Hotter Than This When Did This Become Hotter Than This is an image macro series comparing two sets of photographs featuring celebrities or famous subjects from two distinct time periods or generations What began as a commentary on the everchanging definition of beauty across generations eventually led to online debates regarding the controversial issue of body images and even expanded across areas outside of celebrities such as cute animals and inanimate objects Slut Shaming Slut shaming refers to the practice of criticizing a woman for engaging in certain sexual behaviors outside of traditional gender roles whether it be actual or presumed based on her manner of dress speech or personality Online such practice has been discussed in the context of cyberbullying as some cases have led to teenage girls committing suicide and it remains a popular debate topic among social justice bloggers Check Your Privilege Check Your Privilege is an online expression used mainly by social justice bloggers to remind others that the body and life they are born into comes with specific privileges that do not apply to all arguments or situations The phrase also suggests that when considering another persons plight one must acknowledge ones own inherent privileges and put them aside in order to gain a better understanding of his or her situation The Hawkeye Initiative The Hawkeye Initiative is an art movement in which artists replace female super hero characters shown in impossible body positions with the male Marvel superhero Hawkeye one of The Avengers Mansplaining Mansplaining is an Internet slang term used to describe condescending and inaccurate explanations that are given under the assumption that the audience is entirely ignorant on the subject matter or topic The name stems from an online behavior commonly exhibited by male newbies on femaleoriented discussion forums however any member of either sex can be guilty of mansplaining This Is What I Was Wearing This is What I was Wearing Tell Me I Asked for It I Dare You is the slogan that was originally seen on a sign held by a feminist activist at the 2011 SlutWalk in New York City Online both the slogan and the photograph of the sign have been parodied through image macros and photoshopped images Feminist Taylor Swift Feminist Taylor Swift is a novelty Twitter account that parodies song lyrics of the American pop singer with feminist commentaries on romantic ideals that may be deemed patriarchal or heteronormative Criticisms Feminists have received large amounts of criticism both online and in real life The mens rights movement MRM was founded in the early 1970s3 as a countermovement claiming that men do not hold greater wealth power or societal privilege over women Instead it is the other way around The MRM has grown greatly with a strong online presence with mixed results Feminists criticize the MRM as misogynystic and trying to distract people from feminist issues Several MRM groups have been labeled as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center45 Since the early 2010s the feminist movement on the Internet has come under criticism mainly from its counterpart activists within the socalled Manosphere The Mens Rights Movement The mens rights movement MRM was founded in the early 1970s3 as a reactionary movement to feminism with an aim to dispute the assertions that men hold greater wealth power or societal privilege over women C Plus Equality In December 2013 4chan users announced the launch of a novelty programming language dubbed C Plus Equality in a satirical response to blogger Arielle Schlesingers proposal for a feminist programming language that was posted on Hastac1 a few days prior Operation Fourth Wave Feminism In January 2014 users on the website 4chan launched a series of false flag campaigns known as Operation Fourth Wave Feminism12 in an attempt to undermine various feminist and social justice movements The first hoax dubbed Operation Bikini Bridge aimed to spread pictures prominently displaying a horizontal line that is formed on a womans bikini bottoms as a result of the suspended gap between the bikini and the lower abdomen The goal was to create a rift between second and third wave feminists around the sexualization of thin or physically fit female bodies On January 31st a thread was created on 4chan to announce the launch of Operation Freebleeding which would attempt to promote abstaining from using feminine hygiene products during menstrual period on various social media platforms under the pretense of promoting feminism and selfempowerment Fake Thought Catalog Essay On March 15th 2014 the pop culture blog Thought Catalog13 published an article titled 5 Things Women Need To Do In Their 20s Or Else The Suffragists Died For Nothing which contained a list of recommended lifestyle choices for young women who wish to reap the benefits of the feminist movement urging them to be sexually promiscuous attend parties and major in womens studies The same day Body Building Forums7 member AryanofValhalla posted a thread announcing that he had written the article as a satire under the pseudonym Anne Gus and had received a notification that it had been published In the coming days several news sites published article about the essay including Time9 Gawker10 and the New York Daily News11 On March 18th Thought Catalog8 editor Chrissy Stockton followed up with an article to claim that she had known the article was satirical and that the blog does not have a gender bias in its coverage of feminism

  <textRepresentation>South Park is an American animated TV sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network The storyline revolves around four boysStan Marsh Kyle Broflovski Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormickand their adventures and exploits in the fictional small town of South Park Colorado Intended for mature audiences the show has gained both mainstream recognition and critical acclaims for its use of crude language and satirical humor to explore a wide range of current events and topical issues History The show concept was originally developed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from two animated shorts they created during their college years in the early 1990s Jesus vs Frosty 1992 and Jesus vs Santa 1995 which came to be collectively known as The Spirit of Christmas The latter of the two was initially distributed to less than a hundred people via email before bootleg copies of the video began circulating online The film eventually captured the attention of Comedy Central producers who hired Parker and Stone to develop the pilot episode of the series Titled Cartmen Gets an Anal Probe the episode was produced using cutout animation techniques and most of the characters were voiced by the duo Since its premiere in the United States on August 13th 1997 the show has grown into one of the highest rated shows in the network as well as of any basic cable programs throughout the late 1990s and 2000s South Park is Comedy Centrals longest running program to date a total of 230 episodes have aired and the series is slated to run through at least 2016 Reception The pilot episode was positively received and the series quickly began generating buzz among college students By the time the eighth episode Starvin Marvin aired in November 1997 the shows ratings and viewership had tripled and by the second episode of season two Cartmans Mom is Still a Dirty Slut in April 1998 the ratings peaked at a score of 82 out of 10 with 62 million viewers making South Park the highestrated nonsports show in basic cable history Awards The show has received numerous critical acclaims and accolades as well including Time Magazines 100 Best TV Shows of All Time list and Rolling Stones honorable mention as the funniest show on television in 2007 Entertainment Weeklys recognition of the 12th Greatest TV Show of the Past 25 Years and AOLs 16th Best TV Comedy Series of All Time in 2008 among many others Since its debut in 1998 South Park has been nominated for the Emmys nine times and won the award for Outstanding Animated Program three times Related Memes  PROFIT  PROFIT comes directly from season 2 episode 17 which aired on December 16th 1998 In this particular episode the childrens underwear are being stolen from them by gnomes for the purpose of profit The meme is mostly used in troll science saying Step one X Step two X Step 3  Step 4 Profit Derp Derp is an expression associated with stupidity much like the earlier forms of interjections like duh and dur that became quite popular through its recurring usage in South Park most notably by a a character named Mr Derp who briefly serves as the chefs replacement in an episode titled The Succubus They Took Our Jobs They Took Our Jobs is a meme which comes from season 8 episode 7 which aired on April 28th 2004 The episode itself was a parody of the increasing illegal immigration problem in America with illegal immigrants coming from the future Terminatorstyle instead of Mexicans crossing the border Due to the influx of these immigrants who were willing to work for a lower wage many a person in South Park were fired and replaced with one of these immigrants This caused the redneck population of the town to declare the memetic phrase THEY TOOK OUR JOBS which multiple people yelled in a succession of everdecreasing sensibility How it works is if someone yells They took your job someone else then yells it in a more slurred manner and this continues until it becomes four syllables that are completely unable to be comprehended This meme has shown up as a running gag in the show since then specifically twice in season 13 Episodes 10  13 either to make fun of the economic downturn or just to highlight the idiocy of the stereotypical redneck Gingers Do Have Souls Gingers Do Have Souls is a catchphrase associated with YouTuber CopperCab who gained his online following with an emotional rant about how he has been bullied in school because of his red hair color The phrase is believed to have originated from a South Park episode titled Ginger Kids in which Eric Cartman gives an alarming class presentation on the subject of redheaded children and Gingervitis a madeup disease supposedly associated with red hair Sarah Jessica Parker Looks Like a Horse Sarah Jessica Parker Looks Like a Horse is a catchphrase primarily associated with images that compare Sarah Jessica Parkers face to that of a horse The joke is believed to have originated from an episode of South Park titled The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls aired on March 17th 2010 in which the Sex and The City actress is compared to a horse Captain Hindsight Captain Hindsight is an image

  <textRepresentation>The Irate Gamer is a YouTube personality portrayed by Chris Bores who is known for his series of illtempered video game reviews His YouTube series has been frequently compared to Angry Video Game Nerd AVGN also known as James Rolfe leading some fans of AVGN to proclaim Bores to be a ripoff dislike all of his videos and leave an excess of hateful comments and parody response videos on his uploads Online History Chris Bores released his first Irate Gamer video on his YouTube channel1 on April 28th 2007 in which he played the Back to the Future video game for the original Nintendo Entertainment System In the sevenandahalf minute video Bores combined clips from the movie with the gameplay while he gave a relatively hostile overview of his playthrough Many fans initially compared this video to the AVGNs review of the same game uploaded nearly a year earlier as Bores raised many of the same points Rolfe had made in his production As of October 2012 the comments have been disabled on the video due to the controversy it caused In July 2007 Bores launched the official website at irategamercom2 and later that year launched two additional web series In October 2007 Bores uploaded a Ghost Huntersinspired video shown below left in which he and a group of people explored the Patterson Tower3 a supposedly haunted Ohio landmark This video evolved into a supernatural exploration series called Haunted Investigators4 in which Bores and friends visit local places known for being spooky The next month Bores launched Irate Gamer NEO5 a show dedicated to reviewing modern games shown below right In 2008 Bores further expanded his channel adding the series Irate the 80s6 in which he reviews food drinks and toys popular in the 1980s In 2009 Bores began compiling a documentary style show called History of Video Games7 chronicling the growth of both arcade and console games over the years As of October 2012 there are five episodes of this show reaching the release of the console Fairchild Channel F in 1976 In 2011 he began refilming the videos in high definition for a potential DVD release Also in 2011 he launched a Facebook profile8 for himself where he has nearly 1500 friends and publishes updates publicly for people to follow Reputation Silent Robs Criticism On September 11th 2007 a YouTuber known as Silent Rob uploaded a video comparing the Irate Gamer to the Angry Video Game Nerd Rob accused Bores of plagiarism and predicted that his next video scheduled to be a review of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles NES game would be a near copy of Rolfes review9 Since Rob used footage from Irate Gamer episodes the original video was taken down due to a copyright claim by Bores but has since been reuploaded by Angry Video Game Nerd fans Commentary from Other YouTube Reviewers In 2008 Doug Walker the Nostalgia Critic released a video that was part of a faux feud with the Angry Video Game Nerd in which he claims that Rolfe has become the Irate Gamer in respect to the Critics videos after an extremely long series of vulgar insults shown below left This is followed by canned booing and Walker apologizing saying that this comment was

Tohoku earthquake and tsunami March 2011 and the Van earthquake October 2011 rFindBostonBomber On the day after the attacks British Redditor oops777 launched the rFindBostonBombers subreddit as a hub site for community members to collect and analyze photographs and videos that have been captured from the scene Hoaxes The Family Guy Episode Later that same day a YouTube video of an episode clip from Family Guy31 began circulating online which showed main character Peter Griffin triggers explosions with his cell phone and driving over injured victims at the Boston Marathon First uploaded online by conspiracy talk radio host Alex Jones the video was soon revealed to be an edited clip from an episode titled Turban Cowboys that aired on March 17th 2013 in which Peter Griffin becomes a Muslim and discovers that he is part of a terrorist plot to blow up a bridge Shortly thereafter FOX removed the original episode from online streaming services in the light of the tragic reallife event Man in the Red Shirt Another image from the scene that went viral on Facebook depicted a man in a red shirt embracing an injured woman on the ground with an emotional backstory suggesting that the man had planned on proposing to his girlfriend after crossing the finish line32 It was soon debunked as a hoax based on a photograph taken by John Tlumacki for Boston Globe and Getty Images the original description of which read A man comforts a victim on the sidewalk at the scene of the first explosion near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon Mystery Man on the Roof Within hours of the bombings a particular photograph29 of the second explosion taken by Suffolk University student Dan Lampariello began drawing attention from conspiracy theorists after a viewer spotted a hazy figure of a man standing on rooftop at the time of the detonation By 5 pm ET the image had been retweeted at least 5000 times30 and sparked a debate regarding its authenticity and significance in connection to the bombings Blue Robe Guy On April 17th FBI officials released a photograph of one of the backpacks believed to be linked to the bombings shown below left  which quickly spread across the front pages of daily news sites and blogs Within hours amateur investigators on Reddit and 4chan began analyzing photographic evidence gathered from the site shortly before the detonations in an attempt to identify of potential suspects matching the description provided by the authorities By 830 am ET several individuals who were seen in photographs with backpacks moments before the explosions had been marked as persons of interest particularly one man who became known as the Blue Robe Guy for wearing a blue fleece and a black backpack that faintly resembled the one shown in the FBI image shown above right At least 57 photographs brought up during the discussion were subsequently compiled into an Imgur gallery post gaining more than 16 million views in less than 24 hours Investigation On April 18th FBI released the first surveillance photos and videos of two main suspects being sought after In one of the photos posted on the FBI website both suspects were seen wearing black jackets khaki fatigues and black backpacks Shortly after Redditor SPAtreatment posted an image identifying the hat as a Bridgestone golf cap while many others searched for additional photos matching the official description Online Speculations In the early hours on April 19th a Redditor submitted a link to a Huffington Post article36 about Brown University student Sunil Tripathi who had been missing since midMarch implicating that the student might have played a role in the attack The post37 soon reached the front page of Reddit and the speculation continued to spread elsewhere as users on Twitter began reporting that they had heard Tripathi being named as one of two possible suspects via police scanner38 However by the next morning the rumor was debunked as pure speculation after the deadly shootout between the suspects and the police In response the moderator of rFindBostonBombers issued a statement apologizing for the misimplication of Tripathi in the case and cautioning people to refrain from doxing personal information until official confirmation Manhunt Operation Later that same day the investigation saw its first breakthrough in the case when a violent shootout erupted on the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology leading to the death of Boston police officer Sean Collier and a wild police chase in Cambridge During the course of the explosiveridden standoff one of the main suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev was fatally wounded and later pronounced dead at the hospital Ruslan Tsarnis Plea On April 19th as the manhunt for the second suspect continued amidst a citywide lockdown the uncle of the two bombing suspects appeared in a local news interview to publicly denounce the nephews for their alleged involvement and called them losers for shaming the entire people of Chechnya Furthermore when asked if he had any advice for the younger Tsarnaev at large he asked Dzhokhar to turn himself in and ask for forgiveness The uncles emotional address towards his nephews quickly made his name rise to a trending topic on Twitter where his remarks were highly praised by many viewers as patriotic and heartfelt The viral takeoff of Tsarnis interview statement was picked up that same day by The Washington Post45 Gawker46 New Yorker47 and TIME Magazine among many other publications Meanwhile on Reddit48 Tsarni was hailed as an unforgiving patriot through the impromptu advice animal series Uncle Ruslan Aftermath The Arrest The manhunt came to its fruition on the evening of April 19th when a resident of Watertown Massachusetts found a body laying in a pool of blood inside a boat stationed in his backyard suspected to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev The authorities subsequently surrounded the boat and used a thermal imaging device to verify that the body was still moving shown below After exchanging fire with the suspect for more than an hour Tsarnaev was taken into custody and transported to the hospital suffering from multiple gunshot wounds49 On April 22nd after being treated for severe injuries at the hospital Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property resulting in death in connection to the bombings In addition Tsarnaev was also charged with four counts of murder On July 10th 2013 Tsarnaev made his first public appearance at the arraignment for a total of 30 charges to all of which Tsarnaev pled not guilty On January 30th 2014 United States Attorney General Eric Holder released a statement revealing that the federal government will seek the death penalty against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev FreeJahar Movement Similar to the online fandom that grew out of support for Aurora Colorado theater shooter James Holmes the arrest of the younger Tsarnaev was met by supporters who rallied around him on Twitter with the hashtag FreeJahar50 inspired by Tsarnaevs Twitter handle51 that was exposed by Gawker52 the previous day Throughout the third week of April the hashtag was mentioned by several news sites including The Blaze70 Wired71 the Week72 Gawker73 the Huffington Post74 and Heavy75 As of July 2013 the hashtag has been used on Twitter more than 140000 times69 with both serious and mocking sentiments I truly believe that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was set up The govt dont have

blogs claiming his innocence have launched since April The movement saw a renewed interest in July 2013 when a group of supporters assembled in front of the Moakley Federal Courthouse for Tsarnaevs first public hearing chanting Free Jahar81 Two days later The Atlantic82 published a piece investigating the reasons why women have gotten involved in actively supporting the alleged bomber Rolling Stone Cover Story On July 16th 2013 Rolling Stone magazine revealed that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev53 would be featured on the cover of the upcoming August 1st issue along with an editorial piece about Tsarnaevs transformation into a suspected terrorist based on interviews with dozens of his friends teachers and neighbors In less than 24 hours of online publication the feature article accrued more than 1900 comments Rolling Stone also shared the cover on their Facebook page54 generating more than 4500 shares and nearly 15000 comments The post also generated thousands of tweets criticizing the magazine for treating Tsarnaev like a rock star shown below On the 16th Rolling Stone was mentioned on Twitter more than 165000 times according to Topsy Analytics55 a 3126 increase in volume from the previous day New Rolling Stone cover turns the Boston bomber into Jim Morrison A comparison pictwittercomUJKhAMJSGO Judd Legum JuddLegum July 16 2013 Between the evening of the 16th and morning of the 17th the impassioned response to the Rolling Stone cover photo was picked up by dozens of news outlets including Huffington Post60 Buzzfeed61 CNN62 Business Insider63 USA Today64 CBSNews65 and

including CVS and Tedeschis Food Shops59 Within hours the hashtag was used more than 1800 times58 According to a tweet from Fox 25 reporter Catherine Parrotta67 Boston mayor Thomas Menino called the cover a disgrace and plans to contact the publisher Meanwhile supporters of Tsarnaev also slammed the cover68 for calling him The Bomber without being proven guilty shown below Lawyers Jahar should file a lawsuit against the RollingStonea After all Jahar is innocent until proven otherwise a hrefhttpstwittercomsearchq23Justice4JaharampsrchashJustice4Jaharapmdash SupporterJahar mariatmqsil July 16 2013 On the afternoon of July 17th Rolling Stone editors responded to the outcry on their Facebook page83 stating that their thoughts are with the victims of the bombings but they were standing by the story As Tsarnaev fell into the age group of many of their readers they found it necessary to examine all of the layers of his character to gain a better understanding of how a tragedy like this one happened CBS The Good Wife On November 24th 2013 CBS legal procedural drama The Good Wife ran an episode titled WhackAMole84 in which an adhoc investigation launched by a group of online vigilantes on the fictitious social news site Scabbit inadvertently leads to the racial profiling of an American professor of Middle Eastern descent and false accusations of a bombing in Milwaukee Wisconsin fueled by the heated discussions of conjectures theories and circumstantial evidence shown below On the next day Redditor Kneeco28 started a discussion thread about the episode on rtelevision85 where it garnered more than 654 up votes within the first 24 hours while similar articles comparing the episode plot to the timeline of rfindbostonbombers soon followed on Entertainment Weekly Huffington Post Wall Street Journal AV Club TechPresident and Vulture86 just to name a few Trial and Verdict On March 5th 2015 the trial began for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with charges on 30 separate counts including multiple murders and uses of explosives for the purpose of murder since the act was deemed one of terrorism the trial was a federal and guilty verdicts could potentially carry the death penalty as a sentence Massachusetts does not apply the death penalty to its own trials in the state and because of this difference it was substantially more difficult to find potential jurors willing to serve the death penalty87 The trial lasted until April 7th 2015 and the defense admitted Tsarnaevs guilt while simultaneously attempting to portray him as acting under the influence of his older brother Tamerlan The prosecution portrayed him as an equal partner in the carnage On April 8th after less than two days of deliberation the jury found Tsarnaev guilty on all counts 88 On May 15 in a unanimous vote the jury handed down a death sentence in six of the 17 counts Tsarnaev had been found guilty of89 Following the announcement of the verdict US Attorney General Loretta Lynch released a statement praising the decision Dzhokhar Tsarnaev coldly and callously perpetrated a terrorist attack that injured hundreds of Americans and ultimately took the lives of three individuals Krystle Marie Campbell a 29yearold native of Medford Lingzi Lu a 23yearold Boston University graduate student from China and Martin Richard an 8yearold boy from Dorchester who was watching the marathon with his family just a few feet from the second bomb In the aftermath of the attack Tsarnaev and his brother murdered Sean Collier a 27yearold patrol officer on the MIT campus extinguishing a life dedicated to family and service We know all too well that no verdict can heal the souls of those who lost loved ones nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered lifechanging injuries from this cowardly attack But the ultimate penalty is a fitting punishment for this horrific crime and we hope that the completion of this prosecution will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families We thank the jurors for their service the people of Boston for their vigilance resilience and support and the law enforcement community in Boston and throughout the country for their important work90 Search

email or the names Delta Gamma and Sigma Nu My name is redacted and I am the current president of Delta Gamma at the University of Maryland It has been brought to my attention that you recently

email absolutely does not reflect our chapters values nor Sigma Nus and any assistance you can give us is greatly appreciated Identity Revealed The same day the email was leaked on Gawker the author of the email was identified as University of Maryland student Rebecca Martinson Photographs of Martinson were subsequently posted on the Total Frat Move Forums2 shown below where members discussed her

  <textRepresentation>ew Operation Antisec aka Operation AntiSecurity antisecis an international hacktivist campaign launched by a coalition of Anonymous hackers including former members of Lulzsec The operation officially began with the attacks against UKs Serious Organized Crime Agency on June 20th 2011 and still continues with highprofile targets in private business government and even military sectors The groups involved claim that the operation aims to protest government censorship and monitoring of the internet LulzSec members also mentions ending what they believe are corrupt racial profiling and copyright laws as a goal of the operation Background Long prior to the launch of Operation Antisec the broader concept of Anti Security Movement1 was conceived in 1999 as a countermeasure against the cybersecurity industry and their tendency to disclose security vulnerabilities as a scaretactic to drive sales profit in computer security programs According to Wikipedia most of antisecurity attacks started sometime between 1999 and 2000 targeting websites like SecurityFocus SecuriTeam Packet Storm and milw0rm as well as mailing lists like fulldisclosure vulndev vendorsec and Bugtraq as well as public forums and IRC channels The term Anti Security Movement was first introduced in the manifesto document available as an indexed page on the website antisecurityis2 The purpose of this movement is to encourage a new policy of antidisclosure among the computer and network security communities The goal is not to ultimately discourage the publication of all securityrelated news and developments but rather to stop the disclosure of all unknown or nonpublic exploits and vulnerabilities In essence this would put a stop to the publication of all private materials that could allow script kiddies from compromising systems via unknown methods More recently in 2009 several security communities like Astalavista3 and milw0rm4 as well as the popular imagehosting site ImageShack5 have been targeted by AntiSecurity associates The group behind Operation Antisec has claimed that it aims to protest government censorship and monitoring of Internet usage In addition various digital rightsrelated issues like corrupt racial profiling hardline copyright laws and the War on Drugs have been also cited as grounds for launching particular attacks Notable Developments June 20th Lulzsec and Anonymous Join Efforts On June 20th 2011 Lulzsec announced via Twitter it has formed a partnership with the mysterious hacking collective Anonymous under the

Antisecs initial intrusion and data heist the group also claimed it was able to hack their replacement servers and deface all 70 domains We have no sympathy for any of the officers or informants who may be endangered by the release of their personal information For too long they have been using and abusing our personal information spying on us arresting us beating us and thinking that they can get away with oppressing us in secrecy Well its retribution time we want them to experience just a taste of the kind of misery and suffering they inflict upon us on an everyday basis Let this serve as a warning to wouldbe snitches and pigs that your leaders can no longer protect you give up and turn on your masters now before its too late August 19th 2011 Vanguard Defense Hack On August 19th 2011 Antisec released a gigabyte of private documents and 4713 emails obtained from Vanguard Defense Industries VDI the Texasbased firm best known for its development of US military weapons like ShadowHawk

extracted thousands of published emails from an account associated with Vanguards senior vice president Richard Garcia He is also a board member at Infragard an FBI program designed to facilitate cooperation between public and private cybersecurity initiatives The Tech Herald reported that Antisec targeted Vanguard due to their affiliation with a number of state and federal law enforcement agencies including the Texas State Police FBI Department of Homeland Security and US Marshals Service According to their interview with an Antisec associate they were able gain access to Garcias email account through VDIs website though the source wouldnt specify what method was used The VDI data leak will have a searchable index and its own website Within the leaked messages there were emails to several government agencies as well as law enforcement agencies in Arizona Illinois and Ohio each one wanting to purchase or gather information on VDIs unmanned vehicle There were several memos some Confidential most classified as For Official Use Only related to intelligence gathering for various business sectors One such memo several months old warned that a group calling itself Rising Tide

December 24th 2011 members of Anonymous had stolen emails and credit card data from the website of Strategic Forecasting Inc a United Statesbased global security think tank group commonly known as Stratfor Claiming to have retrieved over 200 gigabytes of data the hackers criticized Stratfor in a Pastebin statement11 for being clueless when it comes to database security noting that the passwords were unencrypted and many of them were simply the name of the company After the hacking incident was reported in the news the group posted two sets of credit card information one containing 3956 items and the other with 13191 items On the following day they posted a set of over 30000 items The hackers also stated the credit card data was used to make donations to several charity organizations including the Red Cross Save the Children and CARE though it remains in doubt whether the payments were ever processed to the groups February 2012 Wikileaks Publication of Global Intelligence Files On February 27th 2012 Wikileaks began publishing more than 5 million emails12 from Strategic Forecasting Inc that were allegedly obtained by Antisecaffiliated hackers in December 2011 According to the

contractors such as Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Raytheon and various government agencies Stratfor a selfdescribed publisher of geopolitical analysis based on private intelligence released a statement via its Facebook page on the same day describing Wikileaks decision as deplorable and illegal The firm further asserted that some copies of the emails may have been forged or altered to include inaccuracies though they refused to validate the authenticity of any documents Following the leak numerous Anonymousaffiliated Twitter feeds including AnonOps AnonyOps and YourAnonNews posted links to the Wikileaks page along with warnings about future leaks According to the Wired article12 citing an anonymous source with ties to Anonymous the hackers decided to turn the information over to Wikileaks because the site was deemed more capable of analyzing and publishing the data Basically WL is the ideal partner for such stuff Antisec acquires the shit WL gets it released in a proper manner August 2012 Wikileaks Exposes TrapWire On August 9th 2012 Wikileaks began releasing a new batch of documents regarding a governmental surveillance program known as TrapWire a predictive software designed by the US security firms Stratfor and Abraxas Corp to detect early signs of impending terrorist plots Due to the covert nature of its operations prior to the release of the documents the news was quickly met by baseless speculations and sensational headlines in the blogosphere as well as mainstream news outlets Shortly after the Wikileaks release in August the news site became

  <textRepresentation>Scientology is a belief system created by science fiction author L Ron Hubbard in 1952 inspired by his earlier selfhelp system Dianetics Scientologists believe that humans are limited by traumatic past events that keep them from realizing their immortality The Church of Scientology is devoted to promoting the belief system which has been known for suing critics who claim that the organization abuses and extorts finances from its members Beliefs Scientologists believe that humans are immortal beings that have been infected with the souls of dead aliens which are the root of humanitys problems Founder L Ron Hubbard referred to the historical events causing the alien soul infection as a space opera which included the story of an evil galactic ruler named Xenu According to the story Xenu transported billions of frozen aliens to the planet Earth 75 million years ago dropped them in volcanoes and destroyed them with explosives After the aliens died their souls known as Body Thetans lost their sense of free will and began inhabiting the bodies of humans Online History Scientology and Usenet The Usenet newsgroup altreligionscientology1 was created by Scientology critic Scott Goehring on July 17th 1991 According to Wikipedia2 the group sparked many debates about the organizations practices for several years until December 24th 1994 when several highlevel secret Scientology documents which included the Xenu story were leaked on to the newsgroup by an anonymous poster The Church of Scientology reacted by hiring lawyers to have the documents removed On January 11th 1995 the Scientology lawyer Helena Kobrin sent a message to Usenet servers to delete the altreligionscientology newsgroup from Usenet but the request was ignored Scientologist lawyers then went after newsgroup participants On February 13th 1995 federal marshals raided the homes of Arnaldo Lerma Lawrence Wollersheim Robert Penny Karin Spaink Zenon Panoussis and former Scientologist minister Dennis Erlich on grounds that the newsgroup participants posted copyrighted materials In 1998 and 1999 the newsgroup was hit with several spam attacks flooding the group racist articles with forged message headers to appear as if they were sent by members of altreligionscientology The attacks were referred to as sporgery a combination of spam and forgery Online Campaigns On July 15th 1998 Salon3 published an article titled A Web of their own which reported that the Church of Scientology was distributing starter kits for members to launch their own Scientology websites The article went on to report that the source code of the pages contained long lists of Scientologyrelated keywords which were criticized as an attempt to drown out Scientology critics in web search results In addition to sitebuilding software the starter kits contained a censorship program known as Scieno Sitter which blocked sites critical of the organization On YTMND In June 10th 2006 YTMND4 founder Max Goldberg announced that he had received a ceaseanddesist5 letter from Scientology lawyers requesting the removal of several pages that mocked the organization After Goldberg refused to take down the sites YTMND users responded by creating more Scientologyrelated sites In the month of June alone over 550 YTMND pages were created mocking Scientology On Wikipedia On August 15th 2007 MSNBC6 published an article titled New online tool traces Wikipedia edits which reported that a tool called the Wikiscanner revealed that PCs from the Church of Scientology were removing criticism from the churchs Wikipedia entry On May 29th 2009 The Huffington Post9 reported that the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee ruled to ban access to the website from IP addresses coming from within the Church of Scientology and had restricted several antiScientology editors from certain topics as well Project Chanology On January 14th 2008 a video was leaked on YouTube of the Scientologist actor Tom Cruise extolling the virtues of the Scientology belief system The video began spreading after it was posted on the image board 4chan which resulted in the Church of Scientology sending a take down request to YouTube for copyright infringement In retaliation adhoc group of Internet users known as Anonymous started Project Chanology which initially consisted of prank calls and faxes to Scientology centers and denialofservice attacks against Scientology websites In February the first wave of protests occurred outside Scientology churches around the world Reception Since its inception in 1954 Church of Scientology has been involved in a series of public scandals and legal battles from criminal convictions of its members in Operation Snow White and allegations of financial frauds to various accusations of mistreatment and cultlike oppression of members within the community The Wikipedia entry describes the Church of Scientology as one of the most controversial new religious movements to have arisen in the 20th century News Media Coverage The organizations lack of transparency and secretive or mythical practices have drawn scrutiny from the news media since its early years after the foundation In the 1960s Church of Scientology made the headlines in the United States after Food and Drug Administrations 1963 raid and seizure of the Churchs Emeter devices as illegal medical devices and also received attention in Australia after an official investigative report about the Church titled Anderson Report was published on behalf of the Australian state government in 1965 In the 1970s public scrutiny over the legitimacy of Scientology intensified with the exposure of Operation Snow White the Churchs conspiracy to infiltrate and steal from more than 136 government agencies in 30 countries to purge unfavorable records about the organization and its founder As a result eleven senior members associated with the Guardians Office were convicted of federal crimes and also led to the launch of an investigation into Operation Freakout Throughout the 1980s and 1990s investigative reports and allegations regarding the Churchs commercial activities continued to surface from the news media as well as governmental bodies and courts including a TIME magazine article published in 1991 which describes Scientology as a hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafialike manner In addition scandals about the Church have been covered by a number of major USbased news publications and programs including NBC Dateline Wall Street Journal New York Times and the ASsociated Press among others Criticisms While the criticisms of the Church remain widespread in the news media Scientologists have also made themselves infamous for their counterattack tactics against the detractors or critics of the church oftentimes dismissing their assertions as having an alternative agenda to misrepresent its beliefs The Churchs combat against its critics became highly publicized for the first time in 1967 after the FBI discovered its covert plot known as Operation Freakout which sought to have one of its prominent critics imprisoned or committed to a mental institution in revenge Operation Clambake Operation Clambake is one of the most prominent antiScientology websites hosted at Xenunet and founded in 1996 by Andreas HeldalLund The site regularly publishes criticism of the Church of Scientology including texts of petitions news articles exposs and primary source documents The online publication came into spotlight in 1996 after it became one of the first websites to host secret documents pertaining to Xenu and OT III and at the peak of its popularity the site was ranked as high as the second place in Google PageRank for the term Scientology However many Xenunet pages have been removed from Googles indexes after the Church issued DMCA takedown notices against the documents Related Topics Celebrity Affiliations As early as 1955 Scientology has catered to celebrities and artists when L Ron Hubbard launched Project Celebrity32 to target influential people to join the religion He offered a small plaque as a reward to churchgoers who bring one of them home later opening a Celebrity Centre33 in Hollywood California in 1969 Over the years many notable actors actresses and musicians34 have subscribed to the religion including John Travolta Juliette Lewis Kirstie Alley Beck Jenna Elfman and Tom Cruise Cruise35 began advocating for the religion in 2004 vocally criticizing psychiatry claiming it was a pseudoscience A video interview with the actor in which he spoke about the religion was uploaded via YouTube in January 2008 causing the church to issue the takedowns which sparked Project Chanology Anonymous Campaigns Despite the takedowns Anonymous members continued to reupload the Tom Cruise interview video Seeing Scientology as dangerous36 Anonymous members created the YouTube channel Church0fScientology37 on January 21st 2008 uploading a message to the Church to inform them that they have made it their goal to eradicate Scientology from the internet After this video Scientology blogger Mark Bunker of Xenu TV38 made a response video complimenting their enthusiasm Anonymous members nicknamed him Wise Beard Man39 seeing him as an ally in their war against the religion As of July 2012 there are more than 21600 results for the search query anonymous and scientology on YouTube40 Photos of Anonymous protests and antiScientology media can be found on Tumblr41 under the tag chanology Sporgery Sporgery10 a portmanteau of spam and forgery refers to the act of flooding articles to Usenet newsgroups with altered headers to make them appear like multiple people were submitting the messages It was coined in altreligionscientology in January 1999 by poster Tilman Hausherr11 after more than one million forged articles were posted to the site The unknown spammers took message headers from articles written by critics of Scientology and paired them with body content taken from posts in other newsgroups or gibberish gathered from across the web12 Between October 1998 and July 1999 982716596 bytes of data were spammed to the newsgroup13 maxing out at more than 180 million bytes in July 1999 shown below While the sporgery attackers were never found it is rumored to have been orchestrated by Scientologists13 who had posted about a plan of action to outcreate the entheta on the newsgroup After one phone number was released by an ISP as a possible perpetrator of the spam the subpoena sent to Pacific Bell Telephone for the records on that specific number was challenged by lawyers from the Religious Technology Center15 and quietly settled Scieno Sitter Scieno Sitter16 is a computer program distributed by the religion that blocks sites critical of Scientology from being viewed It was first distributed in 1998 via CDROMs mailed out to church members as software that would help them create their own Scientology website17 These sites once put online were filled with proScientology keywords in their metadata to overload search engines with positive information to outweigh the religions online critics18 The filter itself blocked hundreds of words including web addresses names of critics Scientology terms and the names of current Scientologists who were found posting on altreligionscientology The filter would either remove the offending words from the webpage a person was looking at or completely shut down the browser if it contained trigger words like Robert Vaughn Young the name of a former church member who later wrote about his experiences or Xenu The CD stated that the program was created to keep hate mail and entheta or negative ideas suggestions or comments The program was discussed on the AE show Investigative Reports19 in December 1998 and mentioned in the 2006 film The Bridge20 where the Scientologist character attempts to access the website Operation Clambake and is shown being unable to Xenu The mythos of Xenu has been discussed on several online outlets despite the churchs effort to keep it under wraps In 1972 Operating Thetan III The Wall of Fire21 was first published in Robert Kaufmans Inside Scientology detailing the story of Xenu capturing and freezing alien bodies and bringing them to earth Operating Thetan III was first published online on December 24th 1994 leading to a legal battle22 about copyright infringement but the posters identity was never discovered The story has been discussed on several other places including the Straight Dope message board23 where L Ron Hubbards science fiction writing background was discussed as part of the creation of the story despite Hubbards claim that his memories from the Xenu era were recalled through autohypnosis On Yahoo Answers24 1111 questions have been asked about the intergalactic dictator Xenu was included in lifestyle site Matador Networks list of 6 Wacky Creation Myths Around the World25 In 2008 the independent online fighting game Faith Fighter was released26 featuring Xenu as the final boss What Scientologists Actually Believe The phrase What Scientologists Actually Believe comes from the November 16th 2005 episode of animated comedy series South Park titled Trapped in the Closet27 After the character Stan joins the religion some members believe he is the reincarnation of its founder L Ron Hubbard While the churchs president explains Scientologys belief system to Stan as per the Operating Thetan III document21 is illustrated as the caption This is What Scientologists Actually Believe is shown onscreen below After the episode aired its mockery became a point of contention for celebrity members of the religion causing the voice actor for Chef musician Isaac Hayes to leave the show28 Online YouTubers began making similar clips with badly drawn art or using material from religious videos to

  <textRepresentation>9GAG is a memesharing website based in Hong Kong but hosted in the United States Launching in 2008 the sites content is mainly a common repetition of many popular memes The site uses the same style of image sharing that sites such as 4chan Reddit and Funnyjunk do but allows people to post with their Facebook accounts and has a like system similar to those found on reddit and Funnyjunk on individual posts 9GAG is infamous on the Internet due to allegations of stealing content from other sites It is also known as being a scapegoat for the various escapades of b and Anonymous similar to Ebaumsworld History On July 1st 2008 Ray Chan and his brother Chris Chan launched 9GAG starting it as a fun side project8 In 2012 they raise 28 million in venture capital That same year 9GAG launched mobile applications on Android and iOS which provided users with streamlined versions of the website as well as the ability to send messages to other users On December 24th 2014 9GAG released an Android game Redhead Redemption a gyroscopebased shooter staring a baby gameplay video below9 As of August 2017 the 9GAG Facebook10 has more than 36 million likes and followers the 9GAG Twitter 11 has more than 118 millions follower and the 9GAG Instagram 12 account has more than 21 million followers Highlights The 9 Rules of 9GAG There are certain rules 9GAG strictly enforces which resemble both The Rules of the Internet and forum rules 1 9GAG is just for FUN 2 9GAG is JUST for fun 3 Get Involved 4 If youre funny you get Likes 5 Play Nice 6 Respect originality and creativity 7 Moderate your content 8 No repost 9 Report Abuse Feud with 4chan In late 2011 9GAG came into conflict with users of 4chan The conflict was provoked by 9gag users claiming to be the creators of memes originating on 4chan 9gaggers also began referring to themselves as a legion which was a blatant copy of Anonymous The noticeable watermark at the bottom of every image taken from 9gag was also a factor as it implied that 9gag had created the image Operation 9GAG On December 21st 2011 4chan members furious over 9GAGs antics planned a raid on the website1 The planned raid included the posting of gore porn and other such materials to the newest uploads section of the website while another team was to perform DDoS attacks on the web server 9GAG hearing of the attack was quick to retaliate forming what they called The 9GAG army They responded to 4chans threat with the following message The 9gag army is coming for you 4chan This only further angered the 4chan members Many threads appeared on b to spur on the operation On 9GAG multiple posts went up in defense of themselves Operation Deepthroat On December 20th 2011 one day before the raid 4chan members launched another op known as Operation Deepthroat2 The operation was to be a three part take down plan involving some of the largest memetic sites on the internet reddit tumblr and funnyjunk Within hours the message had been spread all across the 4 participating websites The Raid On December 20th the raid officially started Hundreds of fake accounts took to the newest uploads section uploading gore and pornography some of it involving children Each entry was quickly downvoted and then removed by the moderators However for as fast as the moderators could work posts continued to fill up the newest uploads page until they ultimately had to shut down all site services including voting new account creation commenting submitting content and viewing the newest uploads This period of high alert lasted for over 40 hours well into the specified raid day Meanwhile as the spam raid continued the clock had struck midnight on the 20th signaling the beginning of the DDoS attacks The attacks had already begun earlier on the 20th but not to full effect Within hours 9GAG was knocked offline in some areas for unknown amounts of time For several locations 9GAG was unreachable and in other places unusably slow However many servers continued to function preventing the massive blackout the op had intended4 9GAGs Retaliation Nearly a day before the 4chan raid 9GAG had discovered their intentions through several posts that had surfaced on the websites Hot page The posts were in fact set up by 4chan users in an attempt to confuse 9gaggers One such post was apparently written by a 4chan member acting as a 9gag member inciting a DDoS attack on 4chan However the coordinates given to them were actually 9gags Unaware of this 9gag members fired upon the given coordinates and DDoSd themselves Due to the servers massive capacity little effect was had 9gag having discovered their mistake launched a DDoS attack on 4chans main page shutting it down for a small amount of time While the homepage was down3 all the boards continued to function allowing for continued raid coordination CyberBully Attack In early January 2012 users of 4chan attacked memorial pages dedicated to a 15yearold suicide victim and promptly blamed 9GAG The trolls posted offensive and mocking materials to the page bringing 9gag under fire from the family This was the first instance of 4chan blaming 9GAG for doing insensitive things and was not the last The German Burger Contest On January 16th 9GAG user schierer posted a picture to try to gain votes for a 9gag burger that he had created for the McDonalds burger contest The 9gag burger quickly gained around 32000 votes putting it in first place by nearly 29000 votes Not to be out done 4chan users concocted their own burger named after moot 4chans creator The McMoot fell far behind the Mc9gag in its early stages However a Twitter user by the name of Matheusavs28 created a votescript for 4chan to use Within days the McMoot had surpassed the Mc9gag by well over 100000 votes The contest clearly stated that the top 20 burgers would be chosen and then tested so for 4chan to insure dominance they created 20 new burgers Each burger surpassed the 9gag burger by about 2030 thousand votes Batman Shooting Hoax On July 19th 2012 during a premier of the third film in Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy a gunman burst into a theater firing into the crowd and killing 14 people Soon after the attack reports surfaced that the man had posted about the attack some weeks prior on 9GAG and that 9GAG users had egged the poster on The image that circulated has been confirmed as a fake and the rumor was spread by btards and other anti9gaggers Related Memes 9GAG Memes 9gaggers in response to allegations that their site only steals existing memes have begun an effort to bring their own memes to light The main three are Sad Frogman  Sad Bear Guy The name is Tad and If you know what I mean Mr Bean These are for the most part only used on 9gag although they have seen some spread beyond it via Facebook Sad Frogman Sad Frogman is a rage face used to express disbelief or a disturbing realization If You Know What I Mean If You Know What I Mean is a rage comic character based on a still frame of actor Rowan Atkinson portraying the fictional character Mr Bean It is used to point out a double entendre in a post or image macro commonly in

  <textRepresentation>Warhammer 40000 aka Warhammer 40K WH40K or simply 40K is a tabletop miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop1 set in a dystopian science fantasy universe of the 41st millennium History The game was created by Rick Priestley and Andy Chambers in 1987 as the futuristic companion to Warhammer Fantasy Battle sharing many game mechanics Expansions for Warhammer 40K are released from time to time which give rules for urban skirmishes planetary siege and largescale combat As of 2013 the game is at its sixth edition which was published in 2012 The background and playing rules of the games factions are covered in the games rule books and supplemental army Codexes along with articles in the Games Workshop magazines White Dwarf2 and Imperial Armour3 In Popular culture The game has become widespread due to the fatalistic and bloody nature of the game being the prime example of grimdark It is common for such things as entire solar systems being eaten by evil gods or daemons to consume the minds of psychic humans The game is sometimes made fun of its nature due to being so over the top The game has an expansive universe prompting hundreds of books based on the universe most notably by a company named Black Library4 and a fair share of video games mostly made by Relic Entertainment5 Presence Online The franchise has a large presence on the Internet There are many forums devoted to it including 40KForums8 DakkaDakka9 Warseer10 and 4chans tg board Over the years tons of fanon have been created from fancreated characters to the entire chapters of Space Marines There is a Wiki11 specifically dedicated to it Much of the fanon can be found at 1d4chan12 which also details the lore behind the many factions of the series and discusses several strategies that players can employ Fans of the franchise are traditionally very devoted and huge amounts of fan fiction and fan art can be found in various sites such as DeviantArt6 Submemes Metal Bawkses METAL BAWKSES a catchphrase spawned from the video game Dawn of War Soulstorm It is said during an assault on the stronghold of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines when playing the Chaos Space Marines In a cutscene describing the Blood Ravens use of Rhino Armored Transports the Chaos Lord refers to them as metal boxes However due to the nature of Dawn of War voice acting it is often spelled as it sounds METAL BAWKSES Spess Mehrens Another voice acting joke from Dawn of War Soulstorm SPESS MEHRENS refers to the leader of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines When the stronghold of the team is attacked a cutscene occurs in which the Force Commander Indrick Boreale delivers a rousing speech However because of the odd accent Boreale was given his words come off oddly pronounced with unusual emphasis Blood For The Blood God BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE is an extremely common battlecry amongst the Chaos Space Marines faction The phrase roots itself at one of the Four Gods of Chaos Khorne Khorne is the God of War Murder Anger Hate and general Bloodshed hence blood for the blood god His private realm in the Warp is said to be filled with rivers of blood and that he sits upon a throne of skulls made from all who die in battle hence Skulls For The Skull Throne Heresy In the game Humanity has come to worship The Emperor of Mankind who led the Great Crusade to restore humanity to the stars as a one true god The violent nature of the universe coupled with blind faith has led to a church rule of mankind As a result Heresy and blasphemy are the worst crimes a person can commit It is common for Heretics to be used as living fuel burned alive have their soul shredded or as the case is on the battlefield summarily executed Ursarkar E Creed Ursarkar E Creed more commonly known as Creed is the leader of the Imperial forces of Cadia He is known for having a unique rule called Tactical Genius The rule allows him to infiltrate nearly any unit under the ScoutSpecial Rule However many of the things he can infiltrate make no logical sense such as divisions of vehicles Titans and many other things The cry It must have taken some sort of tactical geniusCREEEEED comes from a combination of the name of the rule along with a piece of fan fiction7 Angry Marines The Angry Marines are a popular custom army created by 4chans tg Traditional Games board The chapter members are known their red trimmed bright yellow armor unorthodox fighting style and being constantly angry Their battlecry is ALWAYS ANGRY ALL THE TIME Lots of fanon have been created around this chapter13 Other Just as Planned  Not as Planned  a phrase associated with everything being a plot by Tzeentch which involves lots of dickery and nasty trolling Drive Me Closer I Want To Hit Them With My Sword  originates from a picture of a Commissar in a Leman Russ Battle Tank holding his sword high mocking the fact that in a setting with tanks and machine guns people still try to charge the enemy to hit them with a sword The Emperor Protects  a popular quote showing The Emperors godlike authority in the Imperium More Dakka  Dakka is an Ork term for high rate of fire Often used in pictures with gigantic rapidfire weapons WAAAGH  the Ork word for war Its a word that in order to say properly must be shouted The word gains more power the more orks shout it Red Ones Go Fasta  Orks have a strong belief that a red vehicle moves faster than one that isnt This being Orks this is true for them It is considered comedic because it doesnt make logical sense Thin Your

  <textRepresentation>Christine Weston Chandler aka ChrisChan CWC formerly known as Christian Weston Chandler is a YouTube vlogger and creator of the webcomic Sonichu Since late 2007 Chandler became a trolling target by Encyclopedia Dramatica 4chan and Kiwi Farms who frequently mocked his artwork and online behavior Online History Sonichu While attending college Chandler was expelled for a year after attempting to find women by posting signs in public places3 Over the course of this expulsion Chandler began work on the first issue of Sonichu completing it in March of 20054 Although it had originally focused on the Sonichu and Rosechu characters the comic eventually turned focus toward his life Discovery on 4chan Although he had had an online presence since at least 199910 Chandler was not targeted by 4chan until 2007 when a drawing of Sonichu was posted on the imageboard11 Chandlers comics website and YouTube channel were subsequently discovered Chandler subsequently uploaded a video addressing his new followers informing them that he is a highfunctioning autistic shown below Sagas Megan Schroeder  Adam Stackhouse  ED Sagas 20052011 Megan Schroeder was a reallife friend of Chandlers whom he had met in 20055 In 2007 Chandler entered the Chop Chop Master Onions Rap Showdown a Sonyheld contest promoting the PlayStation Portable version of PaRappa the Rappa which some speculated was an attempt to woo Schroeder At the same time a man named Adam Stackhouse created an entry with his sister which ultimately won first place shown below left6 Chandler dejected accused Adam of cheating to win to the point that he made a video of himself shooting a picture of Adam shown below right7 Megan told Chandler that she was glad he lost and was disturbed by Chandlers obsession with her 8 Despite this the two were still friends until March 2008 Soon after the creation of the Encyclopedia Dramatica article14 Chandler discovered it for himself Distressed by the amount of negative attention toward him the large amount bizarre sexuallythemed troll art on the page and a blurry photo taken of him without his consent he declared war on the website denouncing it as slander12 He went on to start a flame war by creating several sockpuppets attempting to write himself in a positive light blanking the page deleting sections of the article getting into arguments on the talk page for the article and uploading his own Rule 34 images including a pornographic image Chandler had drawn of himself engaging in a sexual act with Schroeder named ShecameforCWCjpg13 After discovering Schroeder reportedly broke off communication with Chandler9 In July of 2008 Chandler uploaded a video to vent his anger to the trolls and clarified that the woman in ShecameforCWCjpg was Schroeder and not his fictional daughter as some had theorized shown below Blanca  Jimmy Hill Sagas 20082009 Blanca Weiss was an identity taken on by several catfish trolls in 200849 The first trolling attempts were shared by three internet users who contacted Chandler via instant messaging and telephone The saga culminated with Chandler sending the Sonichu medallion he wore at the time to one of the three trolls Ickeriss69 who destroyed it on camera shown below50 In September 2008 the second trolling attempts were carried out by Encyclopedia Dramatica troll Lordsillynipples who claimed to obtain pornographic photographs from Chandler51 Around the same time of the Blanca saga another troll under the guise of English association football personality Jimmy Hill claimed to be the true creator of Sonichu and that he had turned the series into a successful franchise in the United Kingdom52 Chandler offended by the portrayal of the Sonichu universe in Jimmy Hills version Sonichu as a homosexual Chandler as an evil robot etc as well as the supposed plagiarism of his work addressed him several times On October 13th Chandler addressed Jimmy more directly shown below right54 By February of 2009 Jimmys site was no longer being updated The Clyde Cash Sagas 20082010 Clyde Cash is a pseudonym for a troll who is considered to be Chandlers arch enemy In December of 2008 Clash claimed that his younger brother Ryan Cash killed himself when Chandler spontaneously announced he would stop publishing Sonichu15 Cash began to harass Chandler several times and Chandler responded with an apology video towards Cash shown below left Around this time Chandler drew an image of his new sweetheart named PandaHalo who Cash as an act of revenge on Chandler told him he had raped PandaHalo who in turn supposedly became pregnant55 He later posed as a Nintendo web designer named Gregg Mays in order to take a hold of his website and blackmail him into making a video stating he was gay After that he impersonated Nintendo game director Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo of America president Reggie FilsAime convincing Chandler that a Sonichu game was considered and rejected by Nintendo56 Chandler also uploaded a video directed towards Miyamoto in a bid to prove to him that he is the real Christian Weston Chandler and not a troll shown below left Later Clyde was able to troll Chandler in real life by not only getting another individual Robert Simmons V to act similar to Chandler and actually talk to him16 but by sabotaging a date with another girlfriend who turned out to be another reallife troll via sending a man in a pickle costume to the same location as the date17 Clyde was claimed to be killed on May 22 2009 though this was later proven to be false The image of Lee Hotti became associated with Clyde after Lordsillynipples the same troll who impersonated Blanca told Chandler that this was what Cash actually looked like18 In March of 2010 Chandler would upload a video in which he addresses his rage to many trolls specifically Cash and goes so far as to play out a scenario in which the two of them meet ending in Cashs death The video has since been removed63 Bluespike  Julie Saga BlueSpike was a troll who met Chandler in December 2008 under the alias of Julie a girl who wanted to be Chandlers girlfriend Over the course of their relationship Bluespike claimed to have used the alias to lead Chandler into making a video of himself performing a sex act on an inflatable while yelling Julies name 58 During this time BlueSpike assumed another identity under the alias of Max claiming to be Julies younger brother while still maintaining the Julie persona as a separate character Over the course of an hour in March 2009 Max managed to get into Chandlers PlayStation Network account and threatened to sell it on Ebay and stop Chandler from seeing Julie altogether unless Chandler said Billy Mays is the mayor of CWCville whilst putting his Sonichu medallion into his anal cavity Ivy Saga In March 2009 Chandler met another troll by the name of Ivy who Chandler believed was his girlfriend until later that year The result of Ivy trolling Chandler resulting in him implementing her as a character into Sonichu and many videos about him declaring his love for her in the form of music videos sexual content and later a marriage proposal 28 The saga officially came to an end in July 2009 when Chandler learned that Ivy had committed suicide which he would later reference in the Sonichu comic as a tribute to her 61 Liquid Chris  Kacey Sagas Liquid Chris was a troll who appeared in late June of 2009 claiming that Chandler was an impersonator and that he was the real Chandler 19 He was able to bait Chandler into reacting to him and soon after a CWCivil War trying to prove who was the real Chandlerchan broke out between the two despite Liquid being an obvious imitator The highlight of this was a karaoke competition which the real Chandler later retracted after losing 20 After a two month long period of inactivity Liquids at the time supposed girlfriend Kacey managed to gain contact with Chandler and pretended to almost be tricked by Chandler into going to his house 21 She pretended to break up with Liquid until she learned that Chandler was tricking her Liquid ended his trolling on November 6 with a video saying that he was given permission to marry Kacey 22 Asperchu  CWCipedia Sagas Asperchu is a Sonichu parody comic written by Alec Benson Leary first released on December 4 2009 23 24 Chandler discovered the comic soon after after being sent several homoerotic pieces of artwork featuring the Sonichu and Asperchu characters 25 On January 19 2010 Chandler posted a twelvepage portion of Sonichu featuring the Asperchu characters not only being saved from Alec but also being rewritten into versions of themselves less insulting to Chandler along with an ultimatum insisting that these incarnations were now Asperchu canon 23 Chandler soon apologized for the trouble he was causing 26 This was however seemingly taken back as Chandler soon after uploaded the final pages of Sonichu 10 depicting Alec and the staff of his Asperchu wiki being brutally murdered in various ways 27 The Surfshack Tito and CWC Exile Sagas In March of 2010 Chandler attempted to disconnect himself from the Internet 28 It is commonly believed his former pastoral counselor Rochelle Rocky Shoemaker was behind this exile 29 Although he was seemingly gone Chandler was in reality still around contacting yet another potential girlfriend see below posing as a troll named JenkinsJinkies on the CWCki 30 and uploading various animations for Flipnote Studio 31 He was also covertly photographed at several Fridays After Five in Charlottesville VA 32 This saga ended in late August when three videos leaked of Chandler destroying his PlayStation 3 33 Jackie  Tomgirl Sagas Jacklyn Jackie Romy was a troll who represented herself through a fake alias nicknamed Jackie accompanied by a picture of an anonymous female taken from a set of amateur adult photographs shown below left Chandler first got into contact with her in April of 201042 and the two corresponded via email for several weeks over the course of the month During this period Jackie discovered Chandlers online presence which culminated into a video on April 21st where Chandler describes what sexual acts he would perform on her shown below right4344 Disgusted by his seeming unwillingness to be in a stable relationship Jackie broke off communication with Chandler until July45 She attempted to give Chandler advice on how to improve his life which he ultimately ignored In September 2010 she asked Chandler to draw pictures of he and herself having intercourse to which he obliged He also made several videos targeting Jackies exboyfriend and through October recorded several videos of him cosplaying in order to impress her mostly as various cartoon characters The Jackie saga ended after Chandler stopped replying to her emails at the end of the same month and to many it is still unclear whether Jackie was an online troll pretending to be a female interested in Chandler or if she actually was real In late March of 2011 Chandler sent an email to Jackie about a new interest he had picked up crossdressing 46 At the end of April Surfshack Tito leaked images of Chandler dressed in womens clothing In May he joined the now defunct Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia forum and was soon found out in the next month 47 Over the course of August Chandler made a series of videos named the Calling Out series in an attempt to get trolls to apologize to him only Surfshack Tito met his demands 48 The Tomgirl Saga ended in September with the death of Chandlers father Robert Chandler GAMe PLACe Saga From dates as early as 2002 to 2008 one of Chandlers favorite places to hang out in Charlottesville was the local hobby and game store the GAMe PLACe owned by Michael Snyder Chandler enjoyed coming to the store because they sold video games and trading cards and held weekly tournaments of the Pokemon Trading Card Game which Chandler at the time had an interest in It is also where he met Megan and became friends with her before the events of the ED saga occurred 60 However during his time at the GAMe PLACe Chandler would repeatedly be warned by the stores staff and Michael himself for numerous behaviors and incidents he caused including racism yelling at children poor sportsmanship in card games and video games and disrupting the shopping experience of other customers This information was revealed by two trolls under the aliases of Mimms and Lucas who experienced viewing the behavior firsthand when Chandler was a regular customer 59 In August 2008 Chandler was officially banned from the store by Snyder and was legally not allowed to come back which would lead Chandler to try and convince Snyder to appeal his ban by continuously sending emails to him trying to sneak in the store itself and making apology videos through his YouTube channel at the time to no avail On October 28 2011 Chandler and his mother Barbara Barb Chandler were arrested under the allegation that they had been trying to hit Michael with their car Chandler was sentenced to community service one year of probation and mandatory psychiatric treatment on July 10 2012 nine months after the initial incident occurred 57 Documentary On February 2nd 2015 YouTuber sachumo uploaded a video titled Chris Chan Documentary chronicling the personal

  <textRepresentation>ew Fyre Festival was meant to be an expensive music festival to take place on a private island in Exumas Bahamas However due to poor planning many performers backed out and attendees who had arrived early were left stranded with little food and shelter essentially creating a disasterzone in which fights and looting broke out over resources Background Fyre Festival was produced by entrepreneur Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule who planned the concert as a way to celebrate the launch of Fyre a music booking app It was announced in December of 2016 that the festival would take place between April 28thApril 30th and May 5thMay 7th 20171 Tickets for the event ranged from 1500 to 250000 with the more expensive packages including airfare and luxury villas On January 12th the Fyre Festival YouTube channel uploaded a trailer for the event featuring famous models On April 2nd2 Ja Rule tweeted a flyer for the festival announcing the headliners including Blink182 Migos Major Lazer and more shown below The event was also highly publicized on social media by highprofile models and influencers including Kendall Jenner Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid Developments On March 28th one month before the festival was supposed to begin Twitter account FyreFraud6 was created in order to bring attention to misleading claims made in Fyre Festival promotional material A week later the Wall Street Journal reported that Fyre had difficulty paying its musical acts on time4 On April 26th the day before the festival was supposed to begin in earnest after many attendees had already either departed for or arrived at the island Blink182 announced on Twitter that they were backing out3 The band explained that they believed their performance needs would not be met Attendees noticed organizational problems soon after landing Twitter user WNFIV reported that travellers luggage was handled very poorly Several people shared photos of the disappointing accommodations Some pointed out the drastic difference between the tents attendees were promised compared to the ones they actually received and others noticed that the tents used by Fyre Festival appeared to come from a brand called Relief Tents and are meant as temporary housing for those displaced by disasters One of the mostshared photos of the event came from Twitter user trev4president who showed off the spartan meals given to attendees at what was supposed to be a luxury event As reports about the disastrous event spread FyreFraud posted an image claiming that a lawsuit against

refunds9 However a tweet from DylanACOP says that a piece of computer paper was going around the festival for people to sign so that they could get refunds shown below Social Media Reaction Social media users responded with schadenfreude taking some glee in the conditions the rich attendees were facing rfyrefestival was quickly filled with more trolling than genuine discussion about the event

reactions on Twitter were covered in Telegraph9 On hipinion13 users compared the disaster to Dashcon photoshopping that events infamous ball pit into pictures from Fyre Festival Comrade Ja As news about the festival spread one of the more popular jokes was a theory that Ja Rule was actually a communist and it was his plan to trap wealthy members of the bourgeoisie on a deserted island On the

the day of the event to the aftermath and Fyre Fraud generally going into depth on Billy McFarlane as a character from his childhood up to the festival while also touching on topics such as the millennial generation and social medias role in the festival However both films were criticized regarding the ethicality of their production with Fyre being produced by Jerry Media the media company founded by FuckJerry who also advertised the festival as revealed by Hulus documentary and the producers of Fyre Fraud paying Billy McFarlane a large sum of money for interviews and access to behind the scenes footage in their film according to the director of Fyre Chris Smith GoFundMe Campaign On January 14th 2019 a GoFundMe27 campaign created to raise funds for the Exuma Point Resort was

Lives Matter and police which the commercial purports to ease via Pepsi Background On April 4th 2017 Kendalls mother Kris tweeted the 30second version of the advertisement congratulating her daughter and thanking Pepsi The tweet has since been deleted and the ad has been removed from the internet In the 30 second version of the ad Kendall Jenner is doing a photoshoot in a blonde wig when she notices a protest happening outside At the nod of a handsome protestor Kendall takes off her wig smears off her lipstick and joins the protest She grabs a can of Pepsi and proceeds to hand it to a cop standing by The cop sips it with a smile and the camera zooms in on Kylies face The 240 version is shown below Developments The ad was instantly criticized on Twitter Among the many things people took issue with some of the most popular were the sterile way Pepsi portrayed protests the fact that it seems to suggest a Pepsi would bridge the gap between protestors and police and the positioning of multimillionaire Jenner as a leader of the counterculture One tweet by GrimmKardashian1 shown below said this is everything wrong with our culture in 30 seconds may sound like an overreaction but its not every frame of this ad is poisonous His tweet gained over 7500 retweets and 11900 favorites Many other Twitter users offered detailed analysis of what the ad got wrong For example a popular series of tweets by Olivia A Cole2 mocked the racially tonedeaf nature of several frames of the ad examples shown below Others mocked the ad by inserting cans of Pepsi into famous pictures of protests and instances of police brutality examples shown below Other users mocked and criticized the disconnect between the wholesome way Pepsi portrayed a protest by comparing it to actual Black Lives Matter protests and the general racial tension between black Americans and the police Apology Pepsi at first defended the ad saying it conveyed an important message of harmony below left However amid continued backlash they pulled the ad the following day shown below right On April 6th The Washington Post reported that Pepsis apology to Jenner had also spurred a backlash7 Online activists including Deray McKesson tweeted their outrage toward the soda company examples below He tweeted8 Its incredible that pepsi apologized to Kendall She chose to be a part of that ad Pepsi needs to apologize to the protestors Other users followed criticizing both Pepsi and Jenner for their participation in the commercial as well as Pepsis decision to apologize to its star Media coverage of Twitters reaction was widespread Twitter Moments3 People4 Washington Post5 NY Times12 The Sydney Morning Herald13 The Independent 14 and many more Chemical Brothers Video Comparison Some Twitter users noted that the entire controversy was reminiscent of the music video for Out of Control by The Chemical Brothers6 In the video actress Rosario Dawson drinks a cola during a standoff with Mexican police forces The camera then pans back to reveal the commercial is being played in a store outside of which actual violent protests are happening Protests With Pepsi On April 15th at the Battle for Berkley some appeared and attempted what Kendall Jenner does in the commercial and give the police a can of Pepsi to try and soothe tensions User Vito Gesualdi uploaded a video of himself at the event trying to give cops Pepsi an act he called the Pepsi Challenge shown below left His video gained over 29 million views Channel The Last Stand also attempted the stunt gaining 12000 views shown below

  <textRepresentation>Bronyspeak is the Internet Slang used by the fans of the popular animated Tvseries My Little Pony Friendship is Magic These fans aka Bronies have developed their own vocabulary of slang phrases Many of the words and phrases are taken directly from dialogue in the show while others are completely fancreated and reference tropes found throughout the series Notable Examples Ponify Ponify is the act of turning everyday words into their pony equivalents It is the most common feature of Bronyspeak found in discussions and on threads This originated directly from the show where for example the word everybody is changed into everypony This has spread to a variety of words used in the show such as insults or greetings But fans also gave their own twist to words commonly just being small changes Various Brony Dictionaries have also been made by fans and are shared through sites like DeviantArt2 and Google Docs3 A complete extension for Firefox and Google Chrome has also been made which changes simple words found on the web to their pony equivalents4 The Royal Canterlot Voice  CANTERLOCK The Royal Canterlot Voice originates from Season 2 Episode 4 Luna Eclipsed8 Because of various situations in the show the character Luna has not been around others for a thousand years This caused her to still talk like inhabitants did a thousand years ago using a different form of pronunciation and speaking in a higher volume A similar way of typing is sometimes used amongst fans Creating a similar effect as using an excessive amount of Caps Lock Because of their similarities this has been given the nickname CANTERLOCK Whining Whining originated from a scene in the episode 19th episode of the first season A Dog and Pony Show9 This particular type of whining is used by bronies on threads as a counter to hatefull responses or as a form of brony trolling Bronies respond to the trolls in various over emotional ways similar to Rarity In many cases the poster will replace the word whining with a different verb Notable Catchphrases Various catchphrases have become popular on the web While some of these are taken directly from the show others are completely fancreated For other more detailed descriptions of various phrases and terms see Wingboner  Clopping Flutterrage  Flutterbitch Friendship Arsenal and FOREEEEVER Confound These Ponies Confound these ponies originally started in a series of image macros on co and later spread to the viewers of Yaridovichs Pony Synchtube1 It comes from an episode of Chuck Jones The Dover Boys of Pimento University where the villain proclaims Confound these Dover boys They drive me to drink The verb drink has been turned into a variety of words in fanworks mainly for matching purposes Welcome to the Herd After an individual gets hooked on the show other fans often formally welcome them by saying Welcome to the herd This is commonly combined with an image macro featuring the character Pinkie Pie with hypnotic swirly eyes Other variations of welcoming have also been created along with various catchphrases A popular derivative of this is You shall be assimilated Brohoof The phrase Brohoof is often used to express approval towards another brony and comes from the term bro fist This can be used in an image macro or by typing It is also commonly used as a greeting towards fellow bronies Other words and gestures that feature a hand in some way have also been changed to their hoof equivalents So is the Facehoof a derivative of the facepalm commonly used as a reaction to something silly or senseless Dont feed the Parasprites  Paraspriting Dont feed the parasprites is a catchphrase inspired by the trolling bronies receive in pony threads Parasprite is commonly used in place of troll The parasprite was first introduced in episode 10 of the first season Swarm of the Century11 Parasprites are small bug like creatures with a never ending hunger creating a link with constant trolling bronies have to put up with Love and Tolerate Love and tolerate was created to deal with trolling and hatred in pony related threads while staying true to the shows message of friendship and kindness Love and tolerate is commonly used in place of violent terms in an attempt to stay nonconfrontational It is often used in image macros to express contempt in a joking lighthearted manner Forever Forever is a line which was spoken by Pinkie Pie in the episode Green Isnt your Color It is used in the form of an image macro with Pinkie Pie being edited into various situations 20 Cooler The line It needs to be about 20 cooler was spoken by the character Rainbow Dash during episode 14 Suited For Success12 It is occasionally used as an insult or as simple advice towards something claiming it needs to be improved But it is also used to express approval towards something 20 Cooler can also often be found back in fanworks as a sign of improvement or as a factor for ones opinion 10 Seconds Flat The phrase Ten Seconds Flat was spoken by the character Rainbow Dash during her first appearance in the series13 when she claims that she can clear every cloud from the sky in ten seconds flat It is most often used when describing the ability to perform a task quickly Oatmeal Are You Crazy In episode 3 of the first season The Ticket Master14 the character Pinkie Pie randomly blurts out the phrase Oatmeal Are you crazy The phrase grew in popularity on Ponychans oatmeal board The oat board5 was created for more random pony content and gained its name in honor of Pinkie Pies random nature And Thats How Equestria Was Made In episode 23 The Cutie Mark Chronicles10 Pinkie Pie explains how she got her cutie mark She ends the story by saying And thats how Equestria was made The phrase is commonly used in forum boards as a substitute for tldr and as a reply to offtopic comments I Watch It For the Plot The word plot has become synonymous with the pony posterior as a result of a viral image seen on the left below resulting in the sarcastic phrase I Watch It for the Plot Combinations with Dat Ass have become a common variation creating results such as Dat Plot Dat Flank etc Other Popular Phrases While most of the above phrases are derived from the show they are used often in an exploitable format or in fanworks Various other phrases have been taken directly from the show and are commonly used in the same purpose as they were used in the show They can be most commonly found back in image macros or through videos Certain scenes and phrases in the show have also evolved into popular Pony Reaction Faces A popular place to find these is through the Youtube account of user Kyrospawn6 who has also uploaded various soundboards to his DeviantArt account7 Big Macintosh  Eeyup

do that they the NSA specifically targets the communications of everyone It ingests them by default It collects them in its system and it filters them and it analyses them and it measures them and it stores them for periods of time simply because thats the easiest most efficient and most valuable way to achieve these ends So while they may be intending to target someone associated with a foreign government or someone they suspect of terrorism theyre collecting youre communications to do so The Guardian also reported that Snowden first thought about exposing government surveillance in 2007 but

  <textRepresentation>ew Innocence of Muslims is an antiIslam film allegedly produced and directed by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and Alan Roberts excerpts of which were uploaded onto YouTube in July 2012 The video rose to controversy months later in early September after an Arabictranslated version was aired on the Egyptian TV station AlNas Background On July 2nd 2012 YouTuber SamBacile uploaded two 13minute video clips titled The Real Life of Muhammad and Muhammad Movie Trailer1 which showed excerpts from a fulllength feature film titled Innocence of Muslims produced by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula an Egyptianborn Coptic Christian living in Cerritos California and directed by American filmmaker Alan Roberts Recorded in 2011 under the title Desert Warrior the film features lewd scenes that could be interpreted as denigrating to Prophet Muhammad whose depiction in any shape or form is strictly forbidden by the Islamic law The film remained largely obscure until early September 2012 when duplicate videos dubbed in the Arabic language were uploaded onto YouTube and picked up by Egyptian bloggers and news publications triggering a series of antiAmerican protests in the wake of the videos that have been characterized as antiIslamic As of September 18th the original YouTube clip uploaded by SamBacile has gained more than 95 million views Notable Developments Protests On September 8th the video was picked up and broadcast by the Egyptian TV station AlNas which upstarted its viral momentum on the web On September 11th 2012 antiAmerican protests began erupting outside the US diplomatic mission compounds in Cairo Egypt and Benghazi Libya where four Americans including the ambassador J Christopher Stevens were killed after rocketpropelled grenades and small arms were fired Though some US officials claimed that the attack in Benghazi was planned in advance unrelated to the film it was widely linked to the controversial reception of the YouTube video trailer in the news media Further attacks have been claimed by the Taliban on the British military base Camp Bastion on September 14th and the Islamist militant group HizbiIslami against a minibus carrying foreign aviation workers on September 18th Throughout the week protests spread across the rest of the Muslim world in Iran Lebanon Morocco Pakistan Sudan Tunisia and Yemen On September 18 a female suicide bomber drove a car filled with explosives into a minibus with foreign aviation workers in Afghanistan killing at least nine people reportedly including eight South Africans and a British woman and possibly also a number of Afghans91 The Islamist militant group HizbiIslami claimed responsibility for the attack which was the first reported suicide bombing by a woman in the country and said it was in response to the film92 The Taliban said they attacked the British military base Camp Bastion on September 14 killing two American soldiers in a response to the film and later claimed the base was chosen because Prince Harry was there News Media Coverage The day after the attack in Benghazi Libya Associated Press2 identified a 55yearold California resident Nakoula Basseley Nakoula as the producer of the film Nakoula initially denied any affiliation to the YouTube handle Sam Bacile in the interview but followup inquiries launched by the Associated Press and other news sites like Gawker45 Los Angeles Daily News and LA Weekly linked Nakoula to the account that was used to upload the video and confirm its origin via comment on the day of the Benghazi attack in a duplicate version uploaded by Egypts AlNahar TV Written in Arabic Sam Baciles comment read It is a 100 percent American movie you cows In addition New York Times6 and The Guardian8 provided realtime coverage of the antiAmerican protests in the Muslim countries Cast and Crews Response That same on September 12th CNN12 published an official statement release from the films 80 cast and crew members who denounced the film and asserted that the depiction of Muhammad was added post production through overdubbing without their knowledge or consent The entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer We are 100 not behind this film and were grossly misled about its intent and purpose  We are shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred Restricted Access In the wake of attacks on the US embassies YouTube announced that it had temporarily restricted access to the video in Egypt and Libya while Afghanistan and Iran decided to block access to the videosharing site altogether The Directors Identity On September 14th Gawker3 published an article titled The Director of Innocence of Muslims Is a Schlocky Softcore Porn Director Named Alan Roberts linking the littleknown director of the film to a number of adult films released in the 1970s and 1980s That same day Vice Magazine released a copy of the films postproduction invoice records that listed a payee named Robert Brownell which according to his associates is Alan Roberts real name interviews with Bacile Newsweek Hashtag MuslimRage On September 17th Newsweek15 featured a column essay titled Muslim Rage  The Last Gasp of Islamic Hate by Ayaan Hirsi Ali as its cover story of the week To go along with the article the magazine launched the Twitter hashtag MuslimRage to encourage its readers to share their thoughts on the topic Want to discuss our latest cover Lets hear it with the hashtag MuslimRage Newsweek Newsweek September 17 2012 Within half an hour of Newsweeks tweet the hashtag was overtaken by tweets illustrating trivial and innocuous moments of rage in mocking the magazines word choice on Muslim rage The satire trend on Twitter was picked up by NPR17 Washington Post19 Al Jazeera18 and AFP on the same day Online Discussions Meanwhile on Facebook21 and elsewhere petitions and other forms of protests were launched to convince YouTube to remove the film trailer from the site as well as editorials and image macro commentaries shown below on the issue of censorship and real life consequences of online media2223 Director Sentenced On November 7th 2012 the LA Times24 reported that Mark Basseley Youssef formerly known as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula has been sentenced by a federal judge to one year of imprisonment for violating the terms of release from his 2010 conviction on bank and credit card fraud including the use of fake names and lying to his probation officer Youssef was denied his request for home confinement by United States district court judge Christina Synder on the grounds of continuing deception Youssefs attorney Steven Seiden told reporters that he believed his client was being punished by the government for making the Innocence of Muslims film and the probation case was being used as an excuse to violate his constitutional rights While Assistant US Attorney Robert Dugale claimed Youssef was not here because of the content of the movie he did mention that several cast members had received death threats and feared for their lives The same day The Huffington Post26 published an article reporting that after court was adjourned Seiden approached the front steps of the courtroom to deliver a message from his client saying The one thing he wanted me to tell all of you is President Obama may have gotten Osama bin Laden but he didnt kill the ideology Benghazi Report On December 18th 2012 a report29 authored by the Accountability Review Board was released based on an independent investigation which determined that there were no YouTubeinspired protests outside of the Benghazi embassy prior to the attack and blamed systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies for the lack of proper security Responsibility for the tragic loss of life injuries and damage to US facilities and property rests solely and completely with the terrorists who perpetrated the attacks The Board concluded that there was no protest prior to the attacks which were unanticipated in their scale and intensity On the following day the report was discovered by writer Alex Fitzpatrick from tech news blog Mashable28 which published the findings in an article titled Report No YouTubeInspired Protests Before Benghazi Attack On

  <textRepresentation>ew Fire Emblem Fates Localization Controversy refers to the online backlash that occurred over the changes made to the English version of the Nintendo game Fire Emblem Fates in which several aspects of the game appeared to be changed or removed The localization of the game was handled by the Nintendo Treehouse Nintendo of Americas product development division1 Background Fire Emblem Fates is the fourteenth entry in the Fire Emblem series a tactical roleplaying game On January 16th 2015 Fire Emblem Fates was announced worldwide during the January 2015 Nintendo Direct Session 2 The premise of the game features the main character the avatar default name Corrin in English and Kamui in Japanese must make a choice whether to side with their birth family in the kingdom of Hoshido their adoptive family in the kingdom of Nohr or refuse to side with either kingdom Notable Developments Online Petition On June 25th 2015 an online petition22 was submitted to Changeorg requesting that Nintendo not provide localized versions of Fire Emblem Fates to audiences worldwide As of February 20th 2016 the petition has gained over 7700 signatures Removal of Skinship Skinship also known by its fan nickname Fire Emblem Amie is a minigame that appears in Fire Emblem Fates The player can go to their Private Quarters and invite a character in their army regardless of gender 34 to their home and pet them on the face using the Nintendo 3DS touch screen to strengthen their bonds with the character On January 26th 2016 Nathan Grayson published an article to Kotaku titled The Other Ways Nintendo Is Changing The English Version of Fire Emblem Fates 5 The article had stated that the facepetting minigame had been removed from the English version of Fire Emblem Fates The article had been updated on February 10th 2016 with an exchange between Kotaku and Nintendo added for clarification shown below Kotaku I was told that a feature in which you can use the touch screen to directly touchpet your characters is also out of the localized version Is that the case Nintendo Yes that is the case You might have heard somewhat misinterpreted or exaggerated information about the Japanese original game but even in the Japanese original version we have not included any features which are considered inappropriate in Japan The removal of Skinship was reported to various video game websites such as Nintendo Everything 6 Polygon 7 and the Fire Emblem fan site SerenesForest8 Although face petting is not included in the English version of Fire Emblem Fates the ability to invite someone to your home and receive support bonuses from them remains intact shown below 9 Exclusion of Dual Audio On January 30th 2016 Geniux submitted a screenshot of an email response from Ash Erickson of Nintendo of America that Fire Emblem Fates will not have the Japanese audio track shown below to the rfireemblem 11 subreddit As of February 20th 2016 the post has accumulated 0 points 50 upvoted and 91 comments On February 5th 2016 Nintendo released a statement to Polygon 12 that Fire Emblem Fates would be released in North America in English only Shortly after edibubble submitted a post to the rgames 13 subreddit reporting that the Japanese audio track would not be included in the English version of Fire Emblem Fates The post has gained 712 points 82 upvoted and 370 comments as of February 20th 2016 Although Nintendo did not comment on the reasoning behind the exclusion of the Japanese track several people began theorizing on Nintendos decision In the rfireemblem subreddit 14 vkrili submitted a post suggesting that Nintendo may not have included dual audio because of licensing issues with the Japanese voice actors involved As of February 20th 2016 the post has accumulated 112 points 82 upvoted and 111 comments Soleil  Male Avatar Support After the Japanese release of Fire Emblem Fates on June 25th 2015 a support conversation between the male avatar and Soleil was translated and submitted to Pastebin15 In the original support Soleil gets distracted from fighting cute girls in the battlefield and it greatly affects her performance She asks for the male avatars help and the male avatar agrees by putting a magic powder in Soleils drink that lets her see men as women and women as men The support came under controversy during the summer of 2015 as the support was interpreted by some people as the male avatar drugging Soleil and that Soleil was undergoing gay conversion therapy1617 When asked about the Soleil support conversation Nintendo released a statement to NintendoWorldReport shown below 18 that any implications of gay conversion or drugging will not be included the North American and European versions of Fire Emblem Fates In the version of the game that ships in the US and Europe there is no expression which might be considered as gay conversion or drugging that occurs between characters The localization keeps the basic premise of the support conversation shown below 19 but instead of using magic powder the male avatar has Soleil wear a blindfold and asks for her to imagine him as a girl In a SerenesForest thread 20 reactions to the new support conversation in general is seen as an improvement to the original Japanese support conversation Nintendos Statement On February 15th 2016 Nintendo released a statement shown below to Kotaku10 indicating that players would be able to interact with SLevel characters However these events were unrelated to the facepetting minigame that was included Japanese version of Fire Emblem Fates In certain circumstances SLevel characters are able to wake up their spouses by blowing into the microphone or by tapping the screen to touch their hair face or shoulder These randomly triggered events are unrelated to the minigame in the Japanese version Beruka and Saizo Support Cut On February 21st 2016 YouTube user stricknit posted a short video of a support conversation between Beruka and Saizo in which each character only speaks in ellipses shown below However in further support conversations between the duo the characters proceed as if the initial support conversation has happened In the Japanese version the specific support conversation features the characters speaking about their personal histories and divulge personal details mostly surrounding assassination Game sites like Crave23 and WCCF Tech24 reported that they believed that the original dialogue might be restored at some point TorrentialDownpour TorrentialDownpour 21 is a hashtag campaign launched in protest to the localization changes in Fire Emblem Fates shown below left as early as January 27th 2016 Prior to the campaign the hashtag was used under a different context by people tweeting about the weather conditions of where they live shown below right Alison Rapps Termination As the aforementioned hashtag campaign and protests against Nintendos localization of Fire Emblem Fates continued to intensify Alison Rapp the spokesperson for Nintendos Treehouse division which handles the translation of the companys Japanese games began engaging in heated debates with the critics of Nintendos localization policies soon becoming a target of online harassment from angry fans of the game as well as proGamergaters and zealous critics of censorship in video games Between late January and February 2016 Alison Rapps hostile exchanges with proGamergaters and other critics of Nintendos localization were picked up by several video game news sites and communities including Medium28 Kotaku25 and Reddits rKotakuInAction29 On March 30th 2016 Alison Rapp announced via her Twitter account30 that she had been terminated by Nintendo shown below while insinuating that the companys decision was in part driven by online harassments she had come under in recent months Nintendos Response Later that same day Nintendo responded to Rapps Twitter comments by issuing an official statement to the press27 in which the company flat out denied any alleged connection between the termination of her employment and the Twitter feud she had become embroiled in while offering an explanation that she was fired because she was moonlighting with a second job a violation of the companys internal policy Alison Rapp was terminated due to violation of an internal company policy involving holding a second job in conflict with Nintendos corporate culture Though Ms Rapps termination follows her being the subject of criticism from certain groups via social media several weeks ago the two are absolutely not related Nintendo is a company committed to fostering inclusion and diversity in both our company and the broader video game industry and we firmly reject the harassment of individuals based on gender race or personal beliefs We wish Ms Rapp well in her future endeavors Search Interest External References 1 NintendoWorldReport  The Treehouse Interview 2 Youtube

  <textRepresentation>ew rplace was an interactive forum hosted on the social networking site Reddit that allowed its users to draw on a blank white canvas by placing a square tile available in 16 available colors and dispensed every 5 minutes on its surface Launched as an April Fools Day event in 2017 the novelty subreddit quickly grew into a social experiment involving tens of thousands of members on the site over the course of its 64hour run Background On April 1st 2017 at 0054 UTC Reddit introduced rplace1 an experimental subreddit comprised of a HTML5based 1000  1000 white canvas on which any member of the site who registered before March 31st 2017 could draw by placing a colored tile square in a 10minute interval in the similar vein of the longrunning online canvas community Drawball By 3 pm in the afternoon the subreddit had garnered nearly 86000 subscribers By the end of the event the subreddit had more than 220000 subscribers Developments Flags Flags of nations were among the earliest recurring motifs to appear on the canvas which soon set off a series of competitive drawing in group efforts from different countries across the world The first known flag war was between Denmark and Sweden13 The similarity of Denmarks flag to Swedens attracted rswedens attention and their attempt to overwrite it which they called as Operation Lilla Blt proved to be successful Another notable flag war erupted between France and Germany Before the war Frances vertical flag was located beside Germanys horizontal flag which became the deciding factor for Germanys success in Operation Annexion14 The battle between the two camps ended after they agreed to make a flag of the European Union over their former battleground In addition a number of other smallerscale flag wars also erupted in other areas of the canvas including the longtime rival nations India and Pakistan which ultimately ended with Belgium prevailing over the Pakistani flag and Norway and Texas which ended with Texas relocation to a spot below Norway Flags have also been targeted by nonflag factions The OSU logos expansion pressured the Philippine flag into relocating to another spot and switching into a vertical position with its wartime version The Estonian flags proximity to the League of Legends logo made it a target of Tyler1s followers who momentarily installed an image of his face on the right side The American flag also fell victim to the Black Voids assault but ultimately recovered Script Usage The Argentine national flag was among the first national flags that appeared on the canvas In an effort to protect the flag from getting overdrawn Redditor Zequez wrote a script that automatically reverted alteration attempts7 The use of the script and variations of it eventually became widespread and it was later suspected as the leading factor of the shutdown8 Red vs Blue The Red Corner and Blue Corner rRedCorner2 and rBlueCorner3 respectively were two of the earliest groups that engaged in competitive drawing Heavily outnumbered from the start the Red Corner soon faded as the Blue Corner took over and became the largest contiguous pixel space at the time of writing Trans Flag  4chan Raid The Trans Flag rTransFlagPlace was another largescale group effort to create a bluepinkwhitepinkbluepatterned stripe spanning the entirety of the canvas both horizontally and vertically Upon taking notice of the LGBTQ campaign 4chans pol b and v boards devised several plans to hijack the stripe by overwriting their existing artwork and projects including a false flag campaign directed at inciting conflict between the Trans Flag group and others shown below topleft corner The Black Void The Black Void was a group dedicated to expanding a contiguous black void across the entire canvas Early on there was a small black demon representing the group but it was later swallowed as the Void expanded as well as a large portion controlled by the Trans Flag Unlike other groups the Black Void never stayed on a fixed place and moved around After their original spot was displaced by the American flag they tried to establish their presence in the paintings for Mona Lisa and the Starry Night as well as the OSU logo OSU Logo Fans of the rhythm video game OSU established a stronghold by the bottommost part of the canvas9 by repurposing a previouslyexisting pink triangle and overwriting with the games logo previous artworks like the D Va bunny from Overwatch the Philippine flag and characters from Five Nights at Freddys and Adventure Time After extracting concessions from their neighbors and establishing control of their area they experienced attacks from fans of League of Legends streamer Tyler1 the Black Void and the Rainbow Road They also had to cede the bottommost part of their area to a group dedicated to building Windows 95s start menu Their rebuilding efforts were underway when the canvas was frozen Pixel Art Throughout the event dozens of iconic logos memes artworks and pop culture references were drawn in the form of pixel art and overdrawn Closure On April 3rd 2017 at 1659 UTC Reddit admin Josh powerlanguage Wardle announced the closure of the canvas to further edits4 leading to the rise of several spinoff sites intended for those who wanted to continue their creations Versions of the feature by Plasteur5 and Pxlsspace11 included CAPTCHAs to prevent the use of scripts5 while ColorThisSpace aims to continue from rplaces final state6 Several artworks in the canvas were left with varying states of damage and rthefinalclean was set up to fix the damage and remove stray pixels12 The black void target of extermination efforts by some members of the group was assigned a spot near Runescapes error message19 Impact Data Visualization Shortly after the closure of rplace many Redditors began analyzing and visualizing the data of rplace over the course of its threeday existence including heat maps and height maps revealing various insights on the level and depth of participation The earlier visualizations were based on incomplete usercompiled data On April 18th 2017 a complete dataset was released20 Tributes Following the closure of rplace the subreddit continued to remain active as many users began commemorating the event by sharing photographs of customdesigned souvenirs featuring the final version of the canvas including jigsaw puzzles photoshopped parodies and memory drawings of the final version Bamboozling Soon a bamboozling scheme emerged on rplace as dozens of Redditors vowed to celebrate rcanvas in an extreme manner such as getting a tattoo of the final illustration should their posts receive at least 5000 upvotes Search Interest External References 1 Reddit Announcement

  <textRepresentation>Electronic Dance Music commonly abbreviated as EDM is a term that represents a wide range of electronically produced music whose genres are generally determined by percussion based instrumentals as opposed to vocals1 It is often performed live in clubs or at festivals by DJs to masses of people who dance andor rave to the mixes the DJs play With a multitude of subgenres EDM has been a mainstay in popular culture over the years through pop radio stations and through internet meme culture with multiple memes that have been spawned by the artists and fanbases attached to the music and its multitude of subgenres Origin and History EDM had its beginnings in the late 1970s with the advent of disco in pop music Over the decades the scene of electronic music grew with new genres being pioneered from Electro and House in the 1980s to Drum  Bass Trance and Hard Dance in the 1990s to 21st century genres of Trap Future Bass and recently Vaporwave Giorgio Moroders Knights in White Satin is one of the earliest known examples of EDM in the form of Disco Impact EDMs staying power over the years has been shown through the everchanging landscape of mainstream pop music and pop culture With the rise of affordable music production software ie Ableton and FL Studio and the flexible nature of the subgenres of EDM pop music has often been impacted over the years by subgenres of EDM including but not limited to Dubstep Trap and House music Examples of modern pop music each utilizing a different sub genre of EDM Clockwise Taylor Swift  I Knew You Were Trouble Dubstep Mark Ronson  Uptown Funk feat Bruno Mars Nu Disco NeYo  Let Me Love You House and Mike Posner  I Took a Pill in Ibiza SeeB Remix Tropical House Criticism Despite its growth and staying power in popular culture much criticism has stemmed over the years for EDM due to the nonorganic sound of the music tracks and the criticism of DJs as not being real musicians as live they only have to

  <textRepresentation>ew YouTube Advertiser Boycott otherwise known as the Adpocalypse refers to a global boycott of YouTubes advertising service by various companies protesting ads run along with content deemed questionable or offensive Background On March 17th 2017 the Times of London6 published an article about advertisements run by the British government and several private sector companies appearing on YouTube videos made in support of terrorist organizations On March 21st Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler published a blog post8 announcing a plan to enforce stricter policies to prevent running ads on offensive content On March 23rd Business Insider reported that more than 250 brands had removed advertising campaigns with Google including McDonalds Toyota ATT PepsiCo Starbucks Verizon and Walmart On March 27th analysts from the brokerage firm Nomura Instinent speculated that Google could lose up to 750 million from the boycott7 Developments Online Reaction On March 27th YouTuber Philip DeFranco posted a video about the controversy shown below Within 72 hours the video gained over 149 million views and 13900 comments On March 29th Ethan Klein of

Update On January 16th 2018 YouTube posted a blog9 entry entitled Additional Changes to the YouTube Partner Program YPP to Better Protect Creators The article details changes to monetization requirements for YouTube video creators particularly the number of hours of watchtime on a channel decreasing the number from 10000 lifetime views to 4000 hours within the past 12 months as a means to ward off bad actors from taking advantage of the program They write Were making changes to address the issues that affected our community in 2017 so we can prevent bad actors from harming the inspiring and original creators around the world who make their living on YouTube A big part of that effort will be strengthening our requirements for monetization so spammers impersonators and other bad actors cant hurt our ecosystem or take advantage of you while continuing to reward those who make our platform great Back in April of 2017 we set a YPP eligibility requirement of 10000 lifetime views While that threshold provided more information to determine whether a channel followed our community guidelines and policies its been clear over the last few months that we need a higher standard Starting today were changing the eligibility requirement for monetization to 4000 hours of watchtime within the past 12 months and 1000 subscribers Weve arrived at these new thresholds after thorough analysis and conversations with creators like you They will allow us to significantly improve our ability to identify creators who contribute positively to the community and help drive more ad revenue to them and away from bad actors These higher standards will also help us prevent potentially inappropriate videos from monetizing which can hurt revenue for everyone YouTubers particularly advocates for smaller creators reacted negatively to policy change as they see this update as creating more challenges for creators with few viewers to become a part of YPP and monetize their videos That day YouTuber10 Kayleigh Kill published a video called The End Of Smaller Creators  New Monetization Guidelines The video shown below outlines the criticisms against the change and received more than 14000 views in less than 48 hours Following the backlash from various YouTube creators the company released a statement detailing their motives behind the updated guidelines They wrote Our recent changes to the YouTube Partner Program YPP are designed to curb bad actors stabilize creator revenue and provide greater assurances to advertisers around where their ads are placed By making these updates to YPP we aim to help creators of all sizes find more success We have many free resources in place such as our Creator Academy and YouTube Spaces to help those just starting out build a community around their channel so that they can rampup fast and monetize their videos Several media outlets covered the policy change including Polygon11 CNET12 TechCrunch13 Gizmodo14 The Daily Dot15

  <textRepresentation>Behind The Meme is a YouTube webseries launched by Kyle Bryce that explains the origins of and offers analysis on trending memes Since its launch in August 2016 the series has grown into a popular meme explainer on the videosharing platform garnering over 600000 subscribers and 50 million channel views within the first six months Despite its active presence on YouTube the series has been the target of derision in certain meme communities due to its tone unoriginal content and the perception that he kills memes after he reviews them by making them accessible to normies Online History Behind the Memes YouTube channel launched on August 12th 20161 The channel is run by Kyle Bryce On his channel he lists a California PO Box His first video was uploaded on August 13th explaining Dicks Out For Harambe shown below As of March 8th 2017 the channel has accrued over 646000 subscribers Some of his most popular episodes have acquired over one million views including his videos for Cash Me Ousside The Dab We Are Number One and Yee Reputation Anthony Fantano Parody On November 12th 2016 thatistheplan the memeexplainer channel of Anthony Fantano released a video on Rickrolling parodying the style of Behind The Meme Fantano criticizes Behind the Memes scripts by reading the entry in broken english He also says the channel talks down to its audience like its full of 6 year olds and accuses the channel of regurgitating information on Know Your Meme The following day Behind The Meme responded to Fantanos video by posting a video where he addressed some of the criticisms Fantano lobbed and got his mom to roast him by calling him a geek Criticisms Though popular Behind the Meme is despised in certain meme communities Often he is accused of being a normie and cancer in comments on his videos ex shown below2 The channel is particularly loathed on memefocused subreddits such as rdankmemes and rMemeEconomy For example on March 8th 2017 an image of a Behind The Meme comments section asking the channel to review Expanding Brain caused a stir in both subreddits In rdankmemes the screenshot was posted with the title Behind the meme if youre out there on Reddit Im begging you dont do this to us This meme is only a boy it has so much to live for shown below3 On rMemeEconomy the subreddit responds to Behind the Meme actions by crying Sell whenever he reviews or is encouraged to review a meme4 Zenzi On February 19th 2017 an anonymous 4chan user took to r9k to complain about Behind the Meme and ask how 4chan could take it down In response another user suggested that in every video 4chan commenters demand he cover Zenzi a meme that doesnt exist and downvote every video in which he doesnt cover Zenzi which they thought would result in Behind The Meme getting frustrated and quitting screenshot shown below It appears the original thread has been deleted though a similar thread has been archived Behind The Meme quickly discovered what was going on and thwarted the attempted 4chan raid by creating an explainer video for Zenzi the same day as the raid The video turned into less of an explainer and more of an extended riff on the elitism of some meme communities Behind The Memes quick and accurate response to Zenzi resulted in the Zenzi raid being deemed a failure Plagiarism Accusations Behind the Meme has been accused in the past for allegedly plagiarizing Know Your Meme In Anthony Fantanos parody of Behind the Meme he sarcastically says This is the part where I regurgitate information I found on Know Your Meme but youre so stupid you think I researched it The channels tendency to steal Know Your Meme information has been a noticeable trend for its followers For example in his episode for What in Tarnation he says6 What in Tarnation is an older saying that is often associated with the Southern states of America The About section for the Know Your Meme entry for the meme reads What in Tarnation is a rhetorical question meaning what in damnation which is often associated with Americans living in the Southern United States expressing incredulous bewilderment Doxxing On June 3rd 2017 Behind The Meme uploaded a Draw My Life episode to his channel in which he admitted his name was Kyle Bryce shown below On August 4th 2017 he uploaded a sincedeleted video explaining Crash Bandicoot Woah This led to him being doxxed On August 5th 2017 Bryce was doxxed by user Jaxon Richardson of Hollaforums who posted links to Bryces social media profiles and his address A thread was posted to rOutOftheLoop7 about the doxxing the next day This led to increased criticism of the channel and another wave of harsh criticism particularly on rmemeeconomy and 4chan though it is currently unclear the extent to which the doxxing has affected Bryces personal life Suicide Vlog Series On September 20th 2018 the Behind the Meme channel uploaded a video titled 1 The Beginning featuring firstperson perspective footage of a man picking up a bottle of vodka in a supermarket shown below left On September 22nd a video titled 2 The Future was uploaded to the channel in which the shows creator discusses how the negative reaction to the

  <textRepresentation>ew United Kingdom Withdrawal From the European Union colloquially known as Brexit short for British Exit refers to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom UK from the European Union EU a regional politicaleconomic union that the country has been a member of since joining its precursor organization European Economic Community EEC in 1973 While the UKs membership status within the EU has been a longstanding topic of debate in the country for decades the public interest surrounding the issue saw an unprecedented resurgence during the months leading up to its EU referendum in June 2016 The referendum ended with 519 of the voters voting to leave the European Union Background Following the end of World War II in 1945 many European countries called for a closer political and economic integration at the regional level During the early years of the discussions the United Kingdom played a vital role in paving the road for several regional organizations in Europe beginning with the Treaty of London in 1949 which established the Council of Europe followed by the admission into the European Economic Community EEC the official predecessor to the EU alongside Denmark and Ireland in 1973 Two years after joining the EEC the UK held a referendum to decide whether the country should remain in the organization which resulted in a 67 approval of continued membership 1975 EEC Referendum On June 5th 1975 the UK held a referendum on whether it should remain in the EEC With nearly all major political parties in favor of remaining in the EEC except for an antiEuropean faction within the ruling Labour party the referendum resulted in the continuation of the UK membership by an overwhelming majority Euroscepticism in the UK Over the following decades Euroscepticism gained significant traction in the UK under the leadership of the Conservative Party and renowned British prime minister Margaret Thatcher who had supported the UKs EEC membership in the 1975 referendum but vocally opposed the concept of European integration at large In 1991 the growing sentiment of Euroscepticism led to the foundation of the AntiFederalist League a minor crossparty coalition against the UKs involvement in European integration which would later rename itself as the UK Independence Party UKIP In 1992 the UK signed the Maastricht Treaty a pillar structure which effectively created the European Union and the singlecurrency zone though it opted out of joining the Euro currency and social chapter in order to preserve its autonomy September 16th 1992 the date on which the UK decided to leave the British pound out of the proposed currency system has since become known as Black Wednesday The UKs optout decision was later weakened with the signing of the Lisbon Treaty under Tony Blairs leadership in 1997 but Euroscepticism saw a resurgence during the early 2010s following the rise of the Conservative Partys David Cameron to power Notable Developments Proposal of 2016 EU Referendum After the Conservative Partys victory in the 2010 general election UK Prime Minister David Cameron formally announced his support for a referendum on the nations EU membership since as early as in 2013 following through with the pledge he had frequently made during his campaign Following his reelection to the office in 2015 Cameron renegotiated several aspects of the UKs membership in February 2016 and announced that the referendum which will determine whether or not the United Kingdom will stay as a member or leave the EU completely would be held on June 23rd 2016 Brexit Brexit a portmanteau of Britain and Exit refers to the hypothetical departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union Stemming from the term Grexit which was introduced by Citigroups chief analysts Willem H Buiter and Ebrahim Rahbari in February 2012 to describe a similar scenario in Greece that was gaining public support during the countrys prolonged financial crisis the earliest use of the word Brexit can be found in a tweet posted by British Influence a UK think tank group that generally advocates Eurocentrism on May 15th 2012 shown below1718 About a month later on June 21st The Economist19 ran an article titled A Brixit looms introducing the term to a larger audience The chances of Britain leaving the EU in the next few years are higher than they have ever been A Brixit looms for several reasons Campaigns There are two main political campaigns associated with the UKs upcoming referendum on the EU membership Vote Leave2 the official advocacy campaign in support of leaving the EU and Britain Stronger in Europe3 the official advocacy campaign in favor of remaining in the EU Brexit Supporters The Vote Leave campaign is supported by several prominent figures within the Conservative Party including Boris Johnson Former Mayor of London and Michael Gove Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice virtually all members of the UK Independence Party and a minor faction within the Labour Party known as Labour Leave as well as supporters of two other proBrexit campaigns Grassroots Out and Leaveeu1 Other notable advocates of Brexit include actor Michael Caine4 professional cricket player Ian Botham4 former English football player Sol Campbell6 as well as the British news outlets The Daily Mail and Daily Express ProEU Supporters The Britain Stronger campaign is supported by several leading members of the Conservative Party including David Cameron Prime Minister George Osborne Chancellor of the Exchequer and Theresa May Home Secretary as well as the leaders of the Labour Party Liberal Democrats Green Party of England and Wales and Scottish National Party SNP Other notable supporters include actor Emma Thompson4 Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson4 and Stephen Hawking5 Campaign Highlights Britains Coming Home On February 22th 2016 Mandy Boylett a former candidate of UKIP in the 2015 general election uploaded a video to YouTube featuring her appearing as two women one with a blond wig singing a proBrexit parody version of the song Three Lions the official anthem of the English football team The video was highlighted by major news media outlets such as Daily Mail7 and the Huffington Post which called it the worst song to come from British politics yet8 and Daily Express9 One of the singers of the original song David Baddiel said that while he and Frank Skinner the other singer did not give permission for the parody to be made they might have done it due to it being brilliantly naff10 As of May 2016 the song has over 575000 views on Youtube Barack Obamas Speech On April 24st 2016 President of the United States Barack Obama held a press conference with David Cameron during his visit to the United Kingdom Obama said during the conference that if the UK were to leave the European Union a trade deal with the US could take up to ten years to make40 Obama was afterwords criticised by the leave campaign for trying to intervene in another countrys affair41 On April 28th four days after Obamas press conference a poll put leave ahead of the remain campaign42 David Camerons WWIII Statement On May 9th 2016 David Cameron speaking to a crowd at the British Museum in London claimed that leaving the EU may cause Europe to descend into war Can we be so sure peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt Is that a risk worth taking I would never be so rash to make that assumption What happens in our neighbourhood matters to Britain That was true in 1914 1940 1989 and it is true in 2016 Camerons remark was reported on by major news media such as the Telegraph27 The Guardian28 the Mirror29 and the Daily Mail30 Boris Johnson quickly responded and said that I think all this talk of World War Three and bubonic plague is totally demented frankly31 Battle of the Thames On June 15th 2016 in an event organized by Fishing for Leave UKIP Leader Nigel Farage Conservative minister George Eustice and Labour MP Kate Hoey led a proLeave flotilla up the River of Thames with the boats filled with proLeave flags and banners Later proremain campaigner Bob Geldorf showed up alongside a proremain flotilla and tried to hijack the protest The two flotillas then started attacking each other spraying one another with water and the Remain side blasting the brexit side with music The socalled Battle of the Thames was highly mocked on Twitter32 Murder of Jo Cox On June 16th 2016 Jo Cox member of the British Parliament for the Labour Party was murdered in West Yorkshire as she was making her way to the local Library where she was supposed to speak The attacker armed with a knife and a gun managed to stab and shot Jo Cox before he was tackled by witnesses The suspect of the attack Thomas Mair had been having a serious case of mental illness for several years Mairs brother says33 Although some media claimed that the attacker had shouted Britain first the name of a farright political party in the UK when he attacked Jo Cox some eyewitnesses deny that claim One who supported the claim was found to be a member of the British National Party which are known to be hostile towards Britain First34 The murder was widely condemned by British politicians from both side of the political spectrum Prime Minister David Cameron called the attack tragic and dreadful35 while Jeremy Corbyn leader of the Labour Party called the attack an attack on democracy36 Other countries such as the Czech Republic37 Canada38 and Australia39 also gave their condolences In addition UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn showed up together to lay flowers as a tribute to Jo Cox Other party leaders such as UKIP Leader Nigel Farage also showed up with flowers CatsAgainstBrexit and CatsForBrexit On June 18th 2016 Scottish internet law scholar Lilian Edwards21 tweeted a photograph of her cat with the hashtag CatsAgainstBrexit and an antiBrexit message urging others in the camp to

Sign Also on June 23rd former British prime minister Tony Blair reaffirmed his support for continued membership in the EU by sharing a picture of himself holding a sign that read I Voted Remain via his official Twitter account48 Within minutes of the tweet some UK Twitter users responded to Blairs message with a handful of photoshopped parodies The Result Throughout the day on June 23rd more than 33 million voters participated in the referendum or 718 of all registered voters in the UK which marked the highest turnout for a national vote since the 1992 general election By close to midnight on June 23rd within two hours of the closure of the polling stations several major British news outlets and international news agencies had begun reporting that votes calling for UKs exit from the EU were leading with 52 of total ballots counted Ultimately the referendum resulted in an overall decision to leave the European Union with 5189 of the total votes Online Reactions By the early morning on June 24th virtually all the major social media platforms had become flooded with varying reactions to the announcement of the referendum results which led several Brexitrelated hashtags to trend globally on Twitter and Facebook Meanwhile Google Trends52 provided a comprehensive report on search queries relating to the referendum According to Google What is Brexit was one of the most searched questions during the hours leading up to the day of the referendum and What is the EU quickly became the second most searched term about the European Union in the UK following the announcement of the poll results on June 24th49 Online Petitions Within hours of the announcement of the results tens of thousands of British internet users in the Remain camp began flocking to online petitions calling for a second round of referendum on Britains exit from the European Union including one that had been started by William Oliver Healey a proBrexit advocate and member of the English Democrats a month before the referendum took place By 1040 pm on June 28th Healeys petition had attracted more than four million signatures about forty times the minimum threshold for any petition to be considered for debate in the Parliament The sudden influx of petitioners which reached a thousand signatures per minute at one point eventually prompted the website to crash on several occasions565758 Impact UKIPs Response When it had become clear that the Leave side had a sizable lead over the Remain campaign Nigel Farage made a speech stating that the referendum is a victory for real people a victory for ordinary people a victory for decent people The next morning Farage said that he was hoping that other countries would be leaving the EU pointing out the Netherlands Denmark and Sweden as examples of countries that may leave the European Union David Camerons Resignation As a result of the referendum UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he would resign from the office of Prime Minister at the Conservative Partys conference in October 201643 International SpinOffs In the following week the ripple effects from the UK referendum inspired several copycat movements overseas including Texit Texas secession from the United States Frexit French withdrawal from the EU Czexit Czech withdrawal from the EU Pexit Polish withdrawal from the EU  among others5354 Calexit Following the election of Donald Trump a Californian movement to secede from the United States gained some traction The movement known as Yes California promises a referendum that would be voted on in 201960 The campaign proposes splitting California up into 16 separate states shown below The case is based on the premise that California would have the sixth largest GDP in the world essentially making it a lesser world power The campaign also argues that California would be more able to deal with education and health care problems within the state were they a sovereign nation The

Davis resigned in protest over what they saw as May compromising towards a softBrexit after May announced she would seek a freetrade area with the European Union for industrial and agricultural goods preserving its access to EU markets This led to talks that Mays party could turn against her and potentially challenge her leadership by triggering a confidence vote that could remove her as Prime Minister However CNN noted it is not likely a challenge would remove May as Prime Minister as she has enough support in Parliament and that even were she to be replaced as Prime Minister her successor would not call an election for fear of losing to the Labour Party66 Jeremy Corbyn leader of the Labour Party tweeted that the resignations showed May had no authority and that her government was in

disagreements led to the resignation of at least two Cabinet ministers and several junior government members Despite dissent the Party agreed to back the deal However others within the party called

  <textRepresentation>Douglas Darien Doug Walker born November 17 1981widely known for creation The Nostalgia Critic is an internet personality and one of the main reviewers and cofounder of reviewing site That Guy With The Glasses Online History Doug Walker first gained notoriety on YouTube where he started The Nostalgia Critic and 5 Second Movies However shortly after his videos garnered complaints from companies such as 20th Century Fox and Lions Gate over copyright Infringement Despite Walker explaining his videos were satirical and thus protected by the United States First Amendment1 YouTube took the videos down anyway In April 2008 Walker created his own site named That Guy With The Glasses as a means to escape YouTube deleting the videos As of June 2008 all of Walkers videos were taken off YouTube Reputation When Walker first started making videos he garnered a giant fanbase for both 5 second videos and Nostalgia Critic The Nostalgia Critic has received high praise from critics and audiences The show averages 100000 to 200000 viewers per week In the third quarter of the 2009 fiscal year alone the series generated 54000 in income from its advertising This income allowed Walker to quit his previous job as an illustrator and to create web television professionally The series and character gained increased fame from a fictional feud between the Critic and fellow web reviewer character The Angry Video Game Nerd played by James Rolfe This began with the Critic launching a satirical attack in an early video The feud took place over many videos in 200809 The two characters and reallife comedians are now the best of friends Walker has informed viewers of Rolfes projects and Rolfe has contributed to some of the Critics subsequent videos such as the Voice in Suburban Knights an attacker in his review of Ponyo for the 200th episode of the Nostalgia Critic and a masked alien in To Boldly Flee Walker posted on his Twitter account that he will make a cameo appearance in Rolfes Angry Video Game Nerd film adaptation This carried on for a few years until his fanbase started to decrease with many saying that the videos were starting to get boring and filled with mindless yelling This unpopularity reached its peak when Walker released a Lets Play of Barts Nightmare2 Many fans saw this as his worst video and became infamous in the Lets Play community with Slowbeef3 the original creator of Lets Play tearing apart the video and the Nostalgia Critic4 This led Walker to spend the first part of his James and the Giant Peach review5 apologizing The Nostalgia Critic The Nostalgia Critic is Walkers most famous character and one of the sites most watched series He is a reviewer who reviews old nostalgic movies and tv shows from the 80s and 90s The critic grew in popularity after a fictional feud with the Angry Video Game Nerd which took place through many episodes ending with the two as well as other TGWTG reviewers having a group fight for the sites first anniversary Feud with Wiseau films On July 13 2010 Walker released a Nostalgia Critic review of cult film The Room to positive feedback However soon afterwards The company behind The Room Wiseau films complained about Copyright Infringement and got the video taken down In response to this Doug created a video poking fun at Wiseau films on 20 July Soon the original video was put back up and as of September 2012 has not been taken down The Death and Return of the Nostalgia Critic On August 23 2012 Walker released the 1st part of the sites fourth anniversary special To Boldly Flee in which The Critic as well as other reviewers from the site set out to try and save MaTi a character from the 90s cartoon Captain Planet6 The final part was released on September 13 in which the Nostalgia Critic sacrifices himself to save the world This lead to many fans speculating to whether or not this meant the end of the Nostalgia Critic A day after on September 14 Walker released a video stating that there would no longer be weekly episodes of the Nostalgia Critic even though the Critic may still appear in future specials and Walker would be moving on to make other series On January 22 2013 a video titled The Review Must Go On announced the return of the Nostalgia Critic The video serves as a followup to To Boldly Flee and a conclusion to Demo Reel his then current and biggest project It revealed that the Demo Reel show was a Purgatory for the character with Donnie being the Nostalgia Critic reincarnated to help him recognize the feelings of being ridiculed At the end Donnie was restored to the Critic persona resulting in the Demo Reel world to be merged with the Plot Hole The video was framed by a fictionalized version of Walker having a writers block and pondering whether to revive The Nostalgia Critic after watching The Odd Life of Timothy Green and finds himself ranting about it like the Critic The schedule is changed to two weeks to provide Walker more time to work on his review Also the Nostalgia Critic is now reviewing newer movies more often so long as they are not currently playing in theaters and available on DVD or any other releasable forms so that he can get the footage needed The official return of the Nostalgia Critic was announced and debuted on February 5 2013 with the first episode being The Odd Life of Timothy Green In addition Walkers Demo Reel costars Malcolm Ray and Rachel Tietz joined the cast for sketches throughout the review 5 Second Videos 5 Second Videos is a video blog in which Walker attempts to explain different movies in a short amount of time 5 Second Videos was one of the two series which walker started on YouTube with the other one being Nostalgia Critic This meant that the majority of videos were taken down due to copyright infringement In 2008 Walker discontinued the series due to concerns the series would become stale Despite this other site reviewers continued the series with their own versions Ask That Guy With The Glasses Ask That Guy With The Glasses or known simply as Ask That Guy is a show with centers around the titular character played by Walker In it hes presented with questions send by fans read by a narrator He then proceeds to respond with the most sick and spiteful answers possibleThis often reveals horrifying and downright disturbing facts about various aspects of his life Bum Reviews Bum Reviews is a series in which Walker plays Chester A Bum a tramp who reviews recent movies in a fast style similar to the Nostalgia Critics review of Transformers The first review was released in May 2008 and starting with the Thor review Walker releases a separate video detailing his real opinions of the films That segment evolved eventually into Sibling Rivalry a show in which he discusses the films together with his brother Rob Walker Demo Reel Demo Reel was Doug Walkers main project after finishing the Nostalgia Critic It is notable for being filmed in a proper studio rather than Walkers basement as the Nostalgia Critic was The show began on October 30 2012 with a parody of Christopher Nolans Batman films The story revolves around Donnie DuPre played by Walker the founder of an independent film studio called Demo Reel who believes he can not only remake famous movies but also make them better with a shoestring budget Doug Walker described it as his personal dream project Demo Reel while still poking fun at movies and Hollywood in general was a far more darker and characterdriven show than the Nostalgia Critic Unfortunately the fans were very polarized about it praising some funny jokes and character development but criticizing the pacing issues and lack of focus This in turn resulted with Demo Reel ending with the return of the Nostalgia Critic How to be a Pirate How to Be a Pirate was a show by Doug Walker that debuted on the site on October 21st 2010 In it a pirate named Black Dog Bill whos real name is Howard tells the viewers proper use and stories

refuse to socialize with him Black Dog Bill tells the audience a bit of gossip about said patron Every video ends with Black Dog Bill telling the people stories of Blood Beard Joe a legendary pirate famed for impossible feats Doug has admitted that the reason for creating this show was to build up a role that Black Dog Bill would play in the original idea for the 3rd Year anniversary then called Ninjas vs Pirates before it eventually became Suburban Knights Merry Zodmas Merry Zodmas was a show where Doug dresses up like Terrance Stamps General Zod from Superman II The show showed up in time for Christmas 2010 and has Zod analyze certain aspects of the holiday season like snowmen and gifts Video Game Confessions In this show Walker plays the role of Dominic the Bartender who retells
